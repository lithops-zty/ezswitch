1. Communicate: Politely inform the person about their behavior and explain why it's not appreciated. You can say, ""Excuse me, but I would prefer if you didn't shove flyers into my hands. It's a bit intrusive.""

2. Be firm: If they continue, you can be a bit firmer, saying, ""I really don't want any more flyers. Please respect my boundaries.""

4. Avoid the area: If possible, try to avoid areas where these flyers-shoving people are.

4. Have you ever been to a pasar malam? If so, what's your favourite stall?
5. What's your favourite thing about living in Singapore? For me, it's the food and the weather.

How to Defend Singapore From Kaiju: A Non-Credible Plan,《 如何 防卫 新加坡 免受 怪兽 侵袭 ： 不靠 谱 的 计划 》,"Step 1: Establish a Kaiju-Proof Barrier

The first step to defending Singapore from Kaiju is to establish a Kaiju-proof barrier around the island. This barrier would be made of reinforced concrete and steel, and it would be designed to withstand the most powerful attacks from the giant monsters. The barrier would be built around the entire perimeter of Singapore, including the sea, to prevent the Kaiju from entering the island.

Step 2: Develop a Kaiju Detection System

The next step is to develop a Kaiju detection system that can detect the presence of the giant monsters before they reach the island. This system would use advanced sensors and radar technology to detect the Kaiju from a distance and provide early warning to the authorities.

Step 3: Train a Special Forces Unit

The Singapore government should train a special forces unit to fight against the Kaiju. This unit would be equipped with advanced weapons and technology, including laser guns and energy shields, to protect themselves and the people of Singapore. The unit would also be trained in hand-to-hand combat and survival skills to deal with the Kaiju in close combat.

Step 4: Develop a Kaiju Repellent

The Singapore government should develop a Kaiju repellent that can be used to","From Singapore, defend how a non-credible plan:

1. Launch a massive PR campaign to convince the world that Singapore is not a target for Kaiju attacks.

2. Build a giant wall around Singapore to keep out the Kaiju.

3. Develop a fleet of tiny submarines to sneak up on the Kaiju and attack them from below.

4. Train a group of elite swimmers to sneak up on the Kaiju and attack them from the water.

5. Develop a giant laser cannon to shoot down any Kaiju that make it to Singapore.

6. Develop a giant robot to fight off the Kaiju.

7. Build a giant underground bunker to hide in until the Kaiju have gone away.

8. Develop a giant magnet to attract the Kaiju to a remote location where they can be safely destroyed.

9. Develop a giant vacuum cleaner to suck up the Kaiju and dispose of them.

10. Develop a giant flamethrower to incinerate the Kaiju."

Low-lying Singapore explores innovations to future-proof coastlines from rising sea levels,低 海拔 的 新加坡 探索 创新 技术 以 未来 - proof 海岸线 的 防护 于 海平面 上升,"Singapore, a low-lying island city-state, is exploring various innovative solutions to safeguard its coastlines from the increasing threat of rising sea levels. This proactive approach aims to ensure the long-term sustainability and resilience of the nation.

One of the strategies being considered is the implementation of nature-based solutions, such as coastal wetlands and mangroves, which can effectively absorb and dissipate the impact of storm surges and waves. These natural barriers not only protect the coastline but also provide valuable habitats for marine life, contributing to biodiversity conservation.

Another approach is the development of vertical infrastructures, such as floating platforms and buildings, that can adapt to the changing sea levels. These innovative structures allow for continuous use and occupancy even in the face of rising waters, ensuring the continuity of essential services and infrastructure.

Singapore is also exploring the use of advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence and big data analytics, to monitor and predict changes in sea levels and coastal erosion. This allows for timely and effective interventions to be implemented, minimizing the risks and impacts of rising sea levels.

Furthermore, Singapore is actively engaging with international partners and organizations to share knowledge, best practices, and collaborative research efforts. This global collaboration enables the nation to stay informed about the latest advancements and innovations in coastal protection and adaptation strategies.",Low-lying Singapore explores innovations to future-proof coastlines from rising sea levels

CNA Explains: Who's to blame in accidents involving motorists and jaywalkers?,CNA 解说 ： 在 发生 车辆 和 过 马路 者 相撞 的 交通事故 中 ， 谁 应 负责 任 ？,"CNA Explains: Who's to blame in accidents involving motorists and jaywalkers?

In Singapore, accidents involving motorists and jaywalkers are a common occurrence. But who is to blame in these situations?

According to the Land Transport Authority (LTA), both motorists and jaywalkers share equal responsibility in these accidents. Motorists have a duty to look out for pedestrians, while pedestrians also have a responsibility to use the pedestrian crossings and obey traffic signals.

However, in some cases, the blame may lie solely with one party. For example, if a pedestrian suddenly dashes across the road without looking, the motorist may not have enough time to react and avoid hitting them. In such cases, the pedestrian may be found at fault.

On the other hand, if a motorist is speeding or driving recklessly and hits a pedestrian who is using the pedestrian crossing, the motorist may be found at fault.

Ultimately, it is important for both motorists and pedestrians to exercise caution and responsibility on the roads to prevent accidents from occurring.","CNA Explains: Who's to blame in accidents involving motorists and jaywalkers?

A few years ago, I decided to take a job as a domestic helper in Singapore to make some extra money for my family back home. I was excited about the opportunity to earn a good salary and help my loved ones. However, my experience in Singapore turned out to be a nightmare.

I was working for a wealthy family who lived in a big house. They treated me like a servant and made me do all the household chores, including cooking, cleaning, and taking care of their children. I had to work long hours, often starting at 6 am and finishing at 10 pm. I had no time for myself and no days off.

One day, the family decided to go on a vacation, and they asked me to stay behind to take care of their house. I agreed, thinking it would be a good opportunity to have some time off. However, things took a turn for the worse.

While the family was away, I started to feel lonely and homesick. I missed my family and friends back home, and I longed for some company. One day, I met a man who was passing by my house. He was kind and friendly, and we started talking. We"

Over the past two decades, budget airlines have transformed the way people travel in Singapore. These airlines offer affordable fares, making air travel accessible to a wider range of people. They have also increased competition in the aviation industry, leading to lower prices and more choices for consumers.

The first budget airline to operate in Singapore was AirAsia, which launched its services in 2002. Since then, several other budget airlines have entered the market, including Tiger Airways, Jetstar, and Scoot. These airlines have disrupted the traditional aviation industry, which was dominated by full-service carriers such as Singapore Airlines and SilkAir.

One of the key features of budget airlines is their no-frills approach. They offer basic services such as transportation and in-flight meals, but do not provide additional amenities such as in-flight entertainment or priority boarding. This allows them to keep their prices low, making air travel more affordable for budget-conscious travelers.

Budget airlines have also changed the way people travel in Singapore by expanding their route networks. They have opened up new destinations, both within Southeast Asia and beyond, making it easier for Singaporeans to explore new","shunfu, shengfu: how shengfu airlines changed shengfu shengfu in shengfu over shengfu years"
CNA Explains: What does it mean for Singaporeans now that NRIC numbers will be unmasked?,CNA   说明 ： 在 新加坡人 之中 ， NRIC 号码 将 不再 mask 后 ， 意味着 什么 ？,"What does it mean for Singaporeans now that NRIC numbers will be unmasked?

In Singapore, the NRIC (National Registration Identity Card) is a unique identification number issued to every citizen and permanent resident. It contains personal information such as name, address, date of birth, and gender.

Until recently, the NRIC numbers were masked for privacy reasons, meaning only the last 6 digits were visible to the public. However, starting from 2023, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) announced that NRIC numbers will be unmasked, meaning the full 9 digits will be visible.

So, what does this mean for Singaporeans?

Firstly, it means that your personal information will be more accessible to the public. This could potentially increase the risk of identity theft or other forms of fraud. It's important to be vigilant and take steps to protect your personal information.

""Singaporean robbed in Barcelona"" (singlish)
""refuses to give up"" (singlish)
""tracks down and confronts culprits"" (singlish)

It's not a formal language, and it's often used in casual conversations.","""Never trust anyone"" - Singaporean rob in Barcelona refuse give up, track down and confront culprit"
Singapore is the only country in SEA where most motorcycle riders use a top-box. Why?,新加坡 是 东南亚 唯一 的 国家 ， 多数 摩托车 驾驶者 使用 顶盒 的 原因 是 ： 新加坡 的 交通 环境 较为 严格 ， 法律 规定 大型 行李箱 必须 使用 安全带 ， 而 顶盒 是 符合要求 的 唯一 选择 。,"The use of top-boxes by motorcycle riders in Singapore can be attributed to several factors. 

1. Space Constraints: Singapore is a small island city-state with a high population density. This means there's limited space for parking and storage. A top-box provides additional storage space for riders, allowing them to carry more items on their motorcycles.

2. Weather Conditions: Singapore experiences a tropical climate with high humidity and frequent rainfall. A top-box can protect riders' belongings from getting wet.

3. Traffic Conditions: Singapore's traffic can be quite congested, especially during peak hours. A top-box can help riders avoid the need to stop and go to their destination to pick up or drop off items.

4. Safety: A top-box can provide a safer storage option for riders as it is less likely to be stolen compared to a backpack or other portable storage options.

5. Lifestyle: Many Singaporeans use their motorcycles for daily commuting. A top-box allows them to carry items like work clothes, lunch boxes, or shopping bags, making their commute more convenient.

Please note that these are general observations and may not apply to every motorcycle rider in Singapore.",Singapore is the only country in SEA where most motorcycle riders use a top-box.
