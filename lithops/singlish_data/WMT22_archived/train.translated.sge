HSBC bank change crime-detecting tool lah, open new business.
"HSBC Holdings, which is the parent company of Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp, has turned the algorithm originally used to detect financial crimes into a tool to open up new business opportunities, said the bank's officials, referencing an algorithm that was first set up following a money laundering scandal."
System combine customer bank-related data and public company ownership/directorship info to identify suitable prospects for HSBC staff, and provide ways to link up with these potential clients via existing customer connections.
HSBC main revenue strategy la one where dey try to get more profits from deir big physical network and customer data, and also use data and AI to boost income, and also to increase overall revenue, which is top priority for interim CEO Noel Quinn.
"Disi ni kenaque buat kawal krimin financial pertama kali guna buat komersial purpose, leh, risikoh sih rendah leh cepat result," kata Global Head of HSB, Stewart Niven.
HSBC refuse to reveal how much profit new system goh expect to bring in, but say overall "network earnings" initiative already bring in billion dollar extra earnings.

System can achieve its intention by linking personal customers and corporate accounts through mutual mapping, detecting abnormal transaction patterns or uncovering hidden links between them.
"Dis system liberate more than 400 staff manpower, so they no need manually check transaction and records, and can concentrate on serving customers instead, said Adrian Rigby, HSBC's global head of trade and receivables finance.
HSBC's Nevilleson say, "They suddenly realised that by tweaking the tool a little bit, they can use it to find more attractive "green flags" potential customers, instead of just looking for the "red flags" of lawbreaking."
"Chap we get da customer data set, combine it wif da Companies House data in UK, den run da algorithm upside down to find out da potential customers, which can be through da Companies House, da company's growth or link up wif existing customers lah," Nevison say.
"This tool lah already map out 22.5 million UK entities and individuals, can identify a link network within three minutes, whereas bank staff usually take three hours to manually build up the mapping, he say."

Nowadays, Saudi visa only issued to expat workers, their families, and Muslim pilgrims lah.
Saudi Arabia Friday say, first time offer tourist visa, open up this very conservative kingdom to holidaymakers, aim to diversify economy, reduce reliance on oil.

But dis strict kingdom lar no drink, got strict rules leh, many people see as obstacle for tourism.
Mohammed bin Salman tryin' to change dis situation through a comprehensive liberalisation movement, which bringin' new cinemas, mixed-gender concerts and sports events to Saudi Arabia.
Peh-keh observers say, international criticism of Saudi's human rights record, including last year's brutal murder of critic Jamal Khashoggi and suppression of female activists, may further deter foreign tourists.

California police shoot black man, no federal charges lah.
Fri, Federal authorities reject civil rights lawsuit against Sacramento cops who shoot unarmed black man dead, sparking protests and changes to state laws limiting police use of deadly force.
US Federal prosecutors office and Federal Bureau of Investigation say, review of federal inquiry into 2018 shooting death of 22-year-old Stephen Clark, shows no "sufficient evidence" to charge cops Terence Mercer-Dumas and Jered Rowe, both to return to work as police officers.
March la, California Attorney General's office leh reject la bring case against two police officers leh sue under California penal code after complete one year investigation, leh say evidence show two police officers have reason to believe their life in danger when suspect approach them leh appear to be carrying gun, but leh turn out suspect got phone la hand.
Fri, Sacramento police also release statement sayin' internal investigation no find any police officer break rules or trainin' requirement.
"Sakramento police chief Daniel Hahn say in statement, "Even tho no police misconduct found in this incident or the process leading up to it, we still go ahead with new strategies to prevent such tragedies happen again."

Authority say police sure Clark got gun when he near police after run from police chase go to his ah ma's backyard. Last night police respond to call of smashed car windows and elderly neighbour's sliding door, and chase Clark.

Last month, lawmakers added an amendment to the oldest law regulating police use of deadly force in the US, making it the strictest force standard in America after all cops complete training.
California's old standard make it very hard to sue cops who shoot first, and even harder to get a conviction. This is based on the principle of "reasonable fear", meaning if the prosecutor or disciplinary board think the cop got scared for his life, he's in the clear.
New law start from Jan 1, lah, say police can only use deadly force when got "life-threatening" situation for police or people around, okay.

Oregon got another round of big strike la.
Tampines Poly staff got plenty complain, mainly about low pay and lack of respect at work. Just look at the pay gap lah, over half of them earn less than S$40k a year (hundreds earn below S$25k). While that's happening, the principal earns S$500k a year, and the four sports coaches earn S$1mil each. Despite the six-figure pay for admin staff, overall admin cost still rising, one-sixth of them even qualify for food vouchers.
"Ah, I want to go on strike cos I feel pay lah cannot guarantee dat people can live in da city dey serve, not fair lah," said Teresa Starkelberg, a 24-year veteran library staff at Portland State University.
"Uni la got mahal mahal leh, staffs suffer la, but management no care. Negotiations start from Feb, break off in mid-Aug, bosses propose some outrageous demands - tiny increase in living cost, no recognition for long-serving staff's qualifications, rise in meal vouchers - staffs find it very disrespectful, even cruel. Fulmer say, "There's an unspoken class system in the uni, and we're at the bottom."
"Ah, fifty years la, educators been takin' a lot of flak. Finally, we stand up lah. Bosses at companies see how their own salaries rise faster than inflation, and they can take classism and squeezed middle class lah, but teachers no goon lah, we tak' it no more."
Oregon State University staff lorh not the only ones takin' action. Oregon is now like a powder keg, wif tensions burnin' hot n' bright. Staff at Fred Meyer's supermarket chain is also goin' full steam ahead wif their employer action, even though no official strike plan yet, but tention's gettin' real high; their union, Local 555 of the Food n' Commercial Workers Union, already callin' for a boycott n' submit a report on unfair labor practices against the chain.
Medical sector la, if 4,500 union members from the local 49th branch of the hospital workers' international union at Kaser Hospital no agree on contract by October before current contract expire (just by temporary new agreement dodge), then they approve strike (98% approval rate). Other sectors, Oregon Nurses Association, represent over 120 nurses at Astoria Hospital, stuck in contract negotiation with hospital management, last contract expired in May, very tight timing leh.
Berli explain say: "Labour movement in Oregon state very strong, very deep too. Part of national wave of labour force growth. People see economic instability, real wages goin' down, solution is collective action on site."
Thisa year, leh see how far dis kind of collective action go, still not sure lah, but if big strike return to Northwest region in 2019, that also very possible. We can only hope dat spirit of action can spread to Midwest agriculture, Southern manufacturing, Texas oilfields, Appalachian coal mines, Northeast construction, Silicon Valley tech giants, and any other sector or industry in between. God knows, everything got its price to pay.

Lead by example leh? Income gap in US reach all-time high lar.
Last year, income gap between rich and poor in America reach highest level since 1967 when US Census Bureau start track income data lah, Washington and New York state got highest income gap leh.
America mite be da richest country in da whole wide world, but its situation also realy suck: super-rich people can always get richer, while poor families often gotta rely on crowdfunding websites like "Support Me" to pay for medical bills. Economic inequality affect both wealth and income, but da latter one is at an all-time high.
"Measurement of income gap leh, got dis ting call Gini coefficient. Gini coefficient minimum 0, means everybody earn same la, maximum 1, means one family own all income leh. Last 50 years, Statistics Department track dis index. 1967 US Gini coefficient 0.397, but 2018 already reach high of 0.485."
"World la got some othah countries with even bigger income gap, including some really powerful economies. Like, South Africa's Gini coefficient in 2014 was estimated at 0.63, Brazil's in 2017 was 0.53. Compared to EU countries, which all got Gini coefficient below 0.4."
New data show dat da areas wit da biggest income gap is also da places where da rich people gather, like Washington D.C., New York and Connecticut lah, and some pretty poor places like Puerto Rico and Louisiana. But da states wit da most economic equality is Utah, Alaska, Iowa, North Dakota and South Dakota leh.
Data from the Census Bureau also show dat family median income growth has plateaued, reachin above $62,000, which is highest level measure by American Community Survey, but growth from 2017 to 2018 only 0.8, drop significantly from previous three years, virtually no growth when considerin inflation.
New stats mite give Dem party hopefuls runnin' in next year's presiden election a direction to go, cos Dem party usually support taxin' rich bosses n' big companies more.
Eh, dis also possible damage da underlying principles behind da existing govt's corporate tax incentives policies, which got parliamentary approval in 2017. Dey aim to entice multinational cos to bring manufacturing jobs back to America, while also making sure dat da income flows to middle-class and lower-income Americans. But in reality, dis seems to only benefit da top bosses with extra income, while da rest of Americans miss out on da economic growth and record-low unemployment benefits. But, got to be someone who pay for da private jet trips la.

Baby Stra lah, born early dis month at Cotswold Wildlife Park in Oxfordshire, first female calf for Monty and Ruby.
This little baby ok lah, take care well, from picture can see it curious leh, sleep with mama on rice straw bed.
In 2009, Rubi lah, mother, and another female named Nancy join the wildlife park, hope to have a baby with Monty, first one in the park.
Last year, Nancy give birth to a female cub name Astrid, which is the third female cub born in the park since it was set up 49 years ago, leh.
"Kotzwelder Wildlife Park CEO Jamie Craige say "We've had huge success breeding our rhino herd on top."
"Stella la sixth baby from Nancy and Ruby's family, and our bull Monty already proven himself to be one good father lah."
"Ah, he's got da perfect mix of da powerful bull and caring parent lah."
"Most satisfai lah, Rubi give birth to a baby cow, very important for da breeding programme, while Strah go to another herd lah, hope she can also be good mom one day."
Rubbi already born two male cubs, one in 2015 called Ian, and another in 2017 called Alan, and Alan still stay in da park, while Ian go to da zoo in Turin, Italy lah.
Ai Ren wei ek week tuah pun jiah si weight about 11 stone.
Captive breeding consider rare lor, female only breed once every 2.5 to 5 years, so window for success very limited ah.
Park say, female rhinos take between 16 to 18 months of pregnancy before give birth to one baby rhino.
It considered one of the animals with longest gestation period among land mammals, second only to elephants' 22 months.
Newborn rhinos can stand up within one hour of birth. After birth, the rhino will immediately try to suckle, even if its legs might be a bit wobbly in the first few days.
It will be suckling mother's breast under her watchful eye for about one year.
Their relationship very close la, small rhino stay with mama under mama's protection at least two years, mama buffalo very fiercely protect young ones, scare off enemies if threaten.
Alex Minassian, a self-employed, involuntary bachelor, told Toronto police he was a member of 4chan's organisation.
Lah, fella in da video supposed to have kill 10 passersby in Toronto, he tell police he belong to some online group of jilted lovers.
Alex Minassian, 26, say himself dat he is a member of 4chan's involuntary celibate (incel) board.
After dat attack on April 23, 2018, he now facin 10 murder chargers and 16 attempted murder chargers in Canada.
“Wah, when police ask me bout d dead one, I tell dem, 'I feel I finish my mission'”
After this happen, people start worry bout online loneliness, anger, and misogyny world.
Minassian say, he encounter assassin in California, who mad angry coz girl reject him.
"Na leh charge leh drive rented van crash into crowd in busy North Toronto area. Eight females and two males die, victim range from 22 to 94 years old."
Minasan still no challenge lah. His trial start from Feb lah, but publishing ban on him be interviewed by police already lift today. Police interview him few hours after attack.
Minasan say, never kena jodoh, virgin, admit use lorry as weapon, want to attack more.
"Ah, he say got other few people online he meet also feel same lah," but add "too chicken to do somethin' to vent lah."
Minasiann self-describe himself as "incel" - short form of "involuntary celibate" lah, this online subculture got link to Toronto attack, California attack, and Florida attack too. Group promote hate for women, sayin' men got right to sex with women lah.
Social scientist and other researchers studying disengaged men think dat "involuntary celibates" (incels) become a buzzword dat rile up some men, who get angry when they get rejected by women and tend to think of violent revenge.
Online, people who share the same interest might use "Chad" and "Stacy" derogatorily, referring to guys who get lotsa action and girls who get lotsa action respectively.
Minasan say he talk abt his sexless life on 4chan, which is notorious site for far-right extremists to post their views.
Cinema in US worry about gun violence repeat, ban Joker fans from dressing up to watch movie
US biggest indie cinema larban audience from dress up watchin' highly-rated Joker movie, which tell story behind Batman villain's background, despite cinema already ban masks or painted faces, still got safety worries lah.
Most US cinemas larang audiences wear mask, paint face or bring toy guns cos back in 2012, some nutcase dress up like Joker, shoot gun and throw tear gas at crowd in Aurora, Colorado, kill 12, injured 70, but still, cinemas still allow people wear non-concealing costume lah.
But dis time, landmark cinema announce, no cosplay lar, viewers can't watch R21 movie Joker.
"Ah hope audience can relax more when they watch movies lah," tell Hollywood reporters Mark Zuckerberg, chairman and CEO of Landmark Theatres.
Company base in Los Angeles, got 52 cinema outlets in 27 locations nationwide, largest professional cinema chain in US lah.
Siai, Cinemark, biggest cinema chain in whole US, base in Kansas, reaffirm that cinema ban "mask, painted faces or any face covering", but welcome cosplayer watch movie.
No mask and toy gun lar, mainly coz of safety issue, but now people worry Joker movie release will inspire copycat shooting. LA police say will have police on standby around cinemas on opening day, while Empire Cinemas say got "NATO- standardised" security measures in place.
America Army warn soldiers to watch out for "unwilling bachelors", usually some unhappy men who cannot get dates, worshipping the Joker, might copy his violent antics.
《Joker》 film directed by Todd Phillips, starring Joaquin Phoenix, open nationwide on Oct 4, expect break box office record. Main character descendant of isolated, mentally ill person, becomes a serial killer with green hair, pale face, arch enemy of Batman.
"Joker" movie get many good reviews after premiere at Venice Film Festival, and win top prize Golden Lion. This horror-thriller film base on comic book, some critics worry it might have bad influence cos it sympathise with bad guy and have too real violent scenes, but film's creators say target audience is mature adults who can tell right from wrong.
Midway Broadcasting Company lah announce today, President Melody Spence Cooper, lah publish new book, expected to be real popular, give tips to female entrepreneurs and bosses on how to succeed. Her book, "A Guide for Female Friends to Succeed in Business", share her ideas and views on how women can speak up for equality in negotiations, and how to use their own version of "alumni network" to push forward in their careers.
Spencer Kuiper alwes quote lotsa anecdotes in da book to explain touchy topics like #MeToo movement and Hillary Clinton's fail in da US presidential election, which got da empowerment movement for American women goin'.
"Female Friends: A Guide to Successful Trading" by Spence Cooper, self-published after his breakout speech at the 2017 Chicago National Association of Women Business Owners conference, is written in a very down-to-earth style, so every ah mah can relate to it.
"Female Friendships: The Ultimate Guide to Successful Trading" very funny leh, also very helpful. Melody combine personal anecdotes, success stories, setbacks with real-life experience, from expressing opinions in meetings to knowing when to make friends, benefit many lah."
As chairman of Midway Broadcasting Corporation, she buy over controlling stake in 1999, become one of top female bosses in US media lah, Midway Broadcasting Corporation be top-notch family-owned media co. with many radio and interactive platforms lah.
T·Shaun Taylor ni lah one of the authors of dis book, she's a journalist, writer and founder of Tree Top Consultancy, a holistic service media consultancy company.
Romania spend millions laa in military base by the Black Sea
Romania spend 2.5 bil euro upgrade military base by Black Sea to counter Russia's growing influence in area, newspaper site reveal base near Bucharest, 200km east, will be NATO standard, can fit up to 10,000 NATO F-35 fighter boys, with mini "city" with kindergarten, sports club, hospital.
Bukit ni jadi pusat aktiviti NATO di Laut Hitam, dan Laut Hitam ni jadi area panas bagi tensi antara Rusia dan Barat. Sejak Moscow ambil Crimea dari Ukraine in 2014, Kremlin start guna base laut dalam di Sevastopol buat misi navy di Syria, jadi tambah kuasa navy di Laut Hitam. Rusia pun block transportasi di area, last year capture tiga buah kapal Ukraine di Kerch Strait.
Romania dan Bulgaria sini di Black Sea, before, they got along with Soviet Union, after Soviet collapse, join NATO and EU. The Times claim, to counter Russian move, they ask NATO to beef up its presence in da area. 500 US troops arrive at Romania airbase in Feb. UK Air Force's Typhoon fighter jet squadron already deploy and done. These planes already intercept Russian fighter jets several times since April last year. Georgia also worry about Russia's ambition, not NATO member but join NATO exercise. NATO Sec Gen Jens Stoltenberg visit Tbilisi in March say NATO prepare for Georgia to join. Ukraine also join exercise, develop relationship with EU since 2014.
"New Berlin Wall" Ukraine lagi got scandal surround lah
Porošenko wanna win Trump's support, coz he worry lor dat his competitor go block him from re-election, which clear da way for Giuliani, who can pressure Ukraine's top prosecutor Yuri Lutsenko (later fired), to investigate Biden and his son, help Trump win re-election.
But Poroshenko hope Trump gov can help him turn things around before the 2 presidential elections in Mar and Apr, no idea leh, but he take big hit, lose big to Zelensky, who's guys now become new target for Trump team to take down Biden.
Democrat wanna impeach Trump president cos of his dealings with Ukraine, but President and his allies counterattack with their own Ukraine scandal. They bring up old news dat Clinton campaign team got linked to Ukraine to try lower Trump's chances in 2016, and also claim Biden use his VP position to block Ukraine investigation of his son, no proof lah.
"Ahah, lor, got see mah country's leaders selibut use power and privilege to get richer or gain political power, already very tired leh, Ukrainians lor; now, got dis scandal, one of da worst since Nixon, most Ukrainians no care lah."
"Ukrainis datok dah hardly pernah be concern by Americans, tapi sekarang dia become centrestage in Washington, which got alot of confusion in Ukraine.  Got also some pride in it, cos after being in the shadow of powerful neighbour Russia for few hundred years, Ukraine no longer be considered stagnate, but instead become pivot point of destinies of one of the world's most powerful countries."
Wah, last week Ukraine Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin, under Poroshenko's command, tweet one bitter message sayin' "Prospects for being 'country that brings down US President' in history books ain't so great lah", but he add "But now everybody knows our capabilities lah."
Pakistani YouTube celebrity Khadim Rizvi's broder sentenced to life imprisonment for honour killing
Kareem Dawud Barlowh, who become famous after photo on social media, get kill leh in July 2016.
Brother of Pakistan social media celebrity Kareem Dawer Baloch, who was found guilty of murder last Fri and sentenced to life imprisonment, is the country's most high-profile "honour killing" case.
Barkhaweh famous lah because of her funny selfies, not a big deal lah in Western standard, but in Pakistan where they super hate feminism, she get kill in July 2016 lah.
Her bro Mohamed Wassim Wahid been arrest leh. Few days later, him say he no regret what he do, admit "sia" kill own sister, say sister behaviour "no can take" leh.
Lawyer Sadaat Mahmud tell AFP leh, court in Murtan in east, sentence him life imprisonment, one high-profile verdict.
He say, "If situation allow, he will be acquit by High Court."
"Earlier, Baloch's mother Anwar Mai tell AFP she hope son get acquit lah."
"Boh injury leh, kill my daughter lah, but my son lah go commit crime."
Baroh's murder go viral worldwide, again callin' for action against this "honor killing" thingy, where a woman die cos she go against da rules of da patriarchy.
Lah women been burn, shoot, stab, and hang for choose own husband or in cases like Baloch, praise own gender bring "shame" to family lah.
Disa kind of murder usually done by family members la. According to Pakistan's Blood Money and Revenge Law, they can go seek forgiveness from victim's relatives.
Three months after dat guy in Baloh get killed, Parliament pass new law, say kill person to protect reputation get life imprisonment.
But whether murder is classified as manslaughter, it's up to the judge lah, which means theoretically, the killer can claim different motives but still get off scot-free.
In Baloh case, her parents initially think lar son no chance get pardon.
But la, think of losing their son also got sad, so they change mind, hope he get pardon.
International pressure on dis case make Paki government take unprecedented step, declare govt together with parents as beneficiaries of victim's estate, but dis force case to continue.
Baloche got some well-known for doin' crazy stuff like strippin' dance for Pakistan's cricket team, and wearin' a red flowy dress on Valentine's Day.
Her actions get her some criticise and threaten, but many people, including young ones, see her as a bold, empowering political statement for women, bringing new landscape to the country.
"Kam" kill la got root from tribe society norms, which still very common in whole South Asia, regulate woman behaviour, but man also can be victim.
"Three Scottish students got award as Europe's top students"
Three students from Dundee University in UK been named Best Graduates in Europe leh.
Dundee University got three of its students voted as Europe's top grad in their respective fields, while five others also get recognition from the judges lah.
Scott Sheridan graduate from molecular genetics, win best grad in Europe in life sciences lah; Chester Conford study master in mental health nursing, win award in nursing, midwifery and community health; Lorra Nibbs win award in visual arts.
Although all three students make it to the worldwide finals, still lose out in the end, with 3,500 students from all over the world competing in the final round.
NUS Deputy Provost Prof Bradley Gray say "To get to this level, our students and graduates are competing with the best of the best from top universities around the world.
"Thousands of students worldwide compete for undergraduate scholarships, and students from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) are among the winners, which reflects well on the quality of our students and the education they receive here."
“Congrats big time to Scott, Chester and Lorah lor for their outstanding achievement, and also to other Dundee student reps who get a lot of praise leh.”
Lah 5 students from Nanyang Technological University also get recognition in top undergraduate awards, which recognises their top academic achievement and share these achievements with global audience.
Five students, Nicholas Gallagher and James Osborne (both Biomedical Sciences students), Ferenc Miklosi Szabo (Medicine), Kathleen Scott (Anatomy), and Vako Yoshida (Philosophy), receive awards.
Dis award goh further enhance da academic achievement of top graduates inside da university, and also help students and fresh graduates worldwide build connection.
Oldest galaxy cluster "Queen's Court"
One int'l team of astronomers using Subaru, Keck, dan Twin Towers telescope, discover 12 galaxy clusters, abt 130 billion years ago, oldest galaxy cluster ever found so far. Biggest galaxy cluster, Amaterasu, found 10 years ago using Subaru, named after Japan's ancient queen, show big galaxy clusters like galaxy clusters exist since universe only 8 billion years old, which is 6% of now.
Nah, galaxy cluster can got many hundred galaxy, but how dey form still got big question mark leh, so astronomers go study ancient universe to understand how galaxy cluster form. Ancient galaxy cluster is like one dense system with many tens of galaxy, which eventually evolve into one big cluster.
Team leader Prof Yurike Dai of Japan's Nat'l Astron Obs say, "Original galaxy clusters are rare, dense, special systems very hard to find. We use Subaru telescope's wide-angle view to map the sky and find these original clusters."
Team discover possible protogalactic cluster z66OD on universe map drawn by Subaru Telescope, which have 15 times the normal density of star cluster from dat era. Later, team use Keck Observatory & Hubble Space Telescope to check spectrum, confirm 12 galaxies exist 1.3 billion years ago, oldest known galaxy cluster so far.
"Niigata" lae, big galaxy Biimiko, which got discover in 2009 via Subaru telescope, got lot of gas inside. Biimiko discoverer, team member Seiji Nagase from Japan's National Astronomical Observatory and University of Tokyo say: "Near big objects like Biimiko, possible got protogalactic cloud. But surprise, Biimiko not in centre, but at 500 million light years away from centre." Irony is, legendary queen Biimiko also live secluded life. Nagase add: "Don't know why Biimiko not in middle. But this result important for understand relation between galaxy cluster and big galaxy."
Nancy Pelosise jadi heroine leh, in book of her daughter Christine Pelosise.
New book by Nancy Pelosi, US House Speaker, out soon, written by her own daughter Christine Pelosi lah.
Tian Ma Book publizied on Thursday dat book "Nancy's Path" by Christine Pelosi go out on November 26. Christine Pelosi book tell how her mom, who got five kids, become first female Speaker of the House, and how she now lead the Democratic Party in Congress under Trump govt. Tian Ma say Christine book weave together her mom's "professional and personal experiences".
Kristin Peh-loh-see currently work as a Demo strategist, write books like "Campaign Training Camp" and "Campaign Training Camp 2.0", leh. Her sister Alexandra Peh-loh-see also one movie maker and journalist, make many documentaries on contemporary politics, lah.
Warren donate money he use to buy lemonade to a charity against abortion.
Senator Elizabeth Warren (Massachusetts Democratic senator) buy drink from two girls selling lemon soda stall in August, she no know lah dat $10 she spend go donate to anti-abortion charity organisation.
“Our daughters think (Warren) very nice lah,” says Trump supporter Dan Michell, whose daughter to one of Warren's supporters to vote for her. “Our daughter say she good person, but we no agree with her politics… cos she support woman right to choose abortion, we say we give her money to anti-abortion cause instead.”
8 Aug, Warren leh bus travel go campaign leh stop at 1 lemonade stall in Iowa, stall got 2 kids, Sienna Michaels and Audriana Billings, both 11 years old.
"Come Iowa, Harlan, stop by lemonade stall, grab a cup, life give lemon, make big structural change!" - Warren on Twitter
Two kids super duper happy see one presiden candidate lah. After photo release, girl Michelle ask parent vote for Mass senator in 2020, but parent explain Warren's view on abortion. Kids and parent decide donate to pro-life charity, Life Education and Defense Foundation, which support anti-abortion law.
"Michaels say, "My daughter tell us, she wan us vote for her." "We talk abou' abortion, say maybe we should donate money to anti-abortion cause, my daughter wholeheartedly agree."
Why need to reclassify vesikovirus and Zika virus: biotech got impact oni
Latest research show dat people need ta adjust how we understand viruses' structure, cos they actually got more complex structures than we thought before. Dis discovery may affect how we categorise them, understand how they form, evolve, infect hosts, and design vaccines against them, got big impact lah.
Lah, in the 50s leh 60s, scientists start get high-resolution pic of viruses, then discover dat the viral coat, or shell, is made up of many copies of same protein, like a outer protective layer to shield the virus's genetic material. Most viruses got typical icosahedral shape, like a 20-sided die, got symmetry.
Shell lah virus' protective layer leh, when scientist discover shell structure, they propose shell got different size and carry different number of genome, so virus can infect host in different way.
"Disa point very important lah, cos if you do good, you get more good back, so you motivate to continue do good things, know?"
Nowadays, scientists can design medicine against virus by considering different shapes of them to improve effectiveness lah.
Two researchers from the Virus Information Research Institute, Anthony Luke, a theoretical biophysicalist from San Diego State University, and Reetun Devallack, a computational biologist from University of York, concluded that many viruses, including common ones like herpes simplex and zika virus, have been misclassified since 60 years ago.
"Although we get structure image of cryo-electron microscope, research people no do mathematical description for different virus structure lah."
"Luke say: "We found twenty-sided coat, six new protein combination lah. So, many virus not just use two well-known coat structure. Now, at least got eight ways to design twenty-sided coat already."
Researchers use generalize equivalent principle tu observe how protein wrap around icosahedral shell.
Research findings by them will be published in Nature Communications on Fri 27 Sep, which also show dat viruses from same structural phylogeny will adopt consistent icosahedral capsid arrangements based on protein composition, providing new method to study virus evolution lah.
Biotech applications lah
Structural biologist can now use dis info to reclassify virus structure, which help reveal molecular and evolutionary links between different viruses.
Dis research also goh guide design of new molecular container for nano technology and bio technology use, help scientist find strategy to assemble protein in shell, which can improve systematic way to develop vaccine against virus.
Lucs say "We can use dis finda to target da assembly and stability of da virus capsid, to prevent it formattin into a whole virus when it infect da host cell, or to break it down after it's already formed. Dis might help us finda anti-virus targets for viruses dat share da same icosahedral structure."
New framework got in all da old viruses, give new predictions on virus capsid structure, and identify common geometric patterns in viruses' long evolution from infecting humans to bacteria, and all other species.
Davolock say, new blueprints also provide "a new perspective on viral evolution, showing larger and more complex viruses emerging through new routes of evolution from simple viruses".
Building application
Geometrik shapes also can be use lor design new buildings and build construction.
Under inspiration from the geodesic dome designed by famous architect Buckminster Fuller, structural biologist Donald Caspar and biophysicist Aaron Klug introduced a geometric framework from 1960s onwards for classifying viruses according to their geometric framework of their viral shells. But with advancements in molecular imaging techniques, including for instance herpesviruses and Zika viruses, more and more three-dimensional reconstructions of viral shells are now deviating from this classic geometric framework.
Luc explain “Study dis introduce a more general framework than da classic Kaspar-Klug structure. It base on da conservation of local vertices form by protein interactions inside da shell. Dis approach find six new type of polyhedral shell structures, while recover two classic ones from da Kaspar-Klug based on high bar and geodesic polyhedra.”
Wisconsin pastor who molest boy get 30 years jail
Former pastor who face charges of molesting boy decades ago in Wisconsin, get 30 years jail.
72-year-old Thomas Erikson get maximum jail term on Thursday, after being found guilty of two child sex abuse charges, which occurred during the late 70s and early 80s while he was serving as a priest at St Peter's Catholic Church, he also gotta register as sex offender lor.
Four blokes go court on Thursday, testify on how the rape affect their lives, one victim also first time appear in public.
Erikson sorry la in court to victim, say he start realise how his action affect victim, at least 11 men claim they get harass by Erikson when he still a pastor.
Erikson leh go leh 1988 la.
Eating too much of this seasoning can harm liver lah.
Cinnamon come from inside of cinnamon tree, one very popular spice, use to flavor many food, even become one of own unique taste lah.
This seasoning got some impressive healthy benefits, like lower da risk of gettin' serious diseases (like heart disease, cancer, or diabetes), so it's a natural lah to be popular.
"But don't juz rush to conclusion la, too much of good thing also can be bad for body, right? In this case, if we eat too much cinnamon, got some side effect also. So, we better be safe la."
"Risk of cancer also increase lah - though cinnamon help lower cancer risk, but it also can cause big time lah. Research show dat cinnamon compound coumarin, if take too much, can increase cancer risk. Scientists say dat over time, coumarin damage our DNA, which cause cancer."
Possible harm to liver - Research shows excessive coumarin intake may also cause liver toxicity and damage, based on studies on the effects of excessive coumarin intake on humans.
Might get mouth ulcers - too much cinnamon can cause serious problem, including mouth ulcers. Thought to be due to cinnamon oil, which is a chemical that can cause allergic reaction if take in large amount. Only those allergic to cinnamon oil will get mouth ulcers.
"Maybe cause breath problem - dis more like general prevent measure lah, cos cinnamon soft, easy inhale, cause cough and vomiting, cinnamon oil also irritate throat. "
可能 cause low blood sugar lah - many people find cinnamon good for body cause it got strong effect in lowering blood sugar, very good especially for those with high blood sugar la. But too much can make blood sugar drop too low, bring new health risks.
Tennessee abortion waiting period trial still pending verdict by judge.
Judge in Tennessee must decide larhow to go, listen to which expert lah.
Nex week Thursday, four-day court case in Nashville, Tennessee try prove dat dis law, which require woman to go clinic twice, 48 hours apart, give dem time to rethink abortion decision, got benefit for dem. Lawyers represent five abortion clinics (out of seven in state) say law no good, just cause lot of hassle.
Both sides agree, some girls dat wanna have abortions actually not sure, while some girls dat already have abortions later regret their decision. But the experts disagree on whether 48 hours waiting period in Tennessee affect these girls or not.
Friday, da state lawyers introduced research from Utah on da 72-hour waiting period, which show dat 8 percent of da women who go see da doc for the first time say no more wanna get an abortion.
University of California, San Francisco sociologist Antonia Biggs, interviewed for this study, agreed that some women might change their minds about having an abortion or were uncertain in the first place, but noted that the study did not show that the waiting period in Utah caused women to change their minds, nor did it find it beneficial in other ways.
Biggs confirm also, no evidence yet dat abortion cause mental health problems for women. She say, one national study compare women who get abortion before due date with those who get rejected by clinics after, find dat both group got same rate of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.
Biggers point out in cross-examination dat dis research no track de mental health outcomes of de three females who change mind after de waiting period, she counter dat earlier in de week Ohio State University professor of psychology Priscilla Coleman testimony dat abortion linked to mental health issues.
Korham testify, she think most scientific papers on abortion got pro-abortion political bias.
Fri, another Memphis gynaecologist from da state testify, he join one very kontroversial online group try block da abortion pill effect, UK doc say he "interface personally wit women who change deir minds on abortion."
Tennessee's waiting period law kick in from mid-2015, Pedraza testify say, he see many woman change mind after take abortion pill want to block effect, some even change mind again end up do abortion.
Klinik ah-chiefs before confirm dat waiting period bring financial difficulties and pressure to wanita. Ah-chiefs also say dat two visits requirement bring challenges to patients and klinik, delayin abortion beyond 48 hours, forcing some wanita to seek surgical abortion, which increase risk of complications. Few wanita forced to wait beyond time frame for abortion.
Guttmacher Institute, which support abortion rights, say dat 14 states in US got laws dat force women seekin' abortion to go to clinic twice, Tennessee one of dem.
District Judge Bernard Friedman mus now decide whether dat waitin' period in Tennessee bring too much hardship to wanana wan wan wan wan wan wan wan wan wan wan wan wan wan wan wan wan wan wan wan wan

Investment in liquefied natural gas (LNG) broke records in 2019 and China saw the highest growth rate.
"Seh dari awal tahun, invest in liquefied natural gas (LNG) reach $50 bil, break all-time high, say International Energy Agency (IEA) chief Fatih Birol at industry conference."
"Ni year, investment for 2019 broke (final investment decision) record high of $50 billion dollar," Biroli say in Tokyo at the LNG producers-consumers conference, as quoted by Reuters.
No surprise lah, investment growth driven by Asia's continous rise in energy demand; expect China to overtake Japan become world's biggest liquefied natural gas importer.
"Major growth comes from China lah. Over next five years, one-third of global demand for liquefied natural gas will come from China only," Biroli say. He add also, five years later, China will be biggest importer of the fuel.
Investment amount grow also not surprising lah, where majority come from America and Canada.
EIA report say lah, expect US liquefied natural gas (LNG) export capacity to double by end of year, reaching 8.9 trillion cubic feet per day, making US third largest LNG exporter after Qatar and Australia. Projected to rise to 17 trillion cubic feet per day by 2030 from initial 2019 figure of 3 trillion cubic feet per day.
"Canada now got only one liquefied natural gas project in progress, Canadian LNG, but its final production capacity can reach 2.8 million tonnes per annum. It cost $31 billion to build, led by Shell, with minority shareholders including Petronas Malaysia, Sinopec China, Mitsubishi Japan, and Korea Gas Corp."
Same time, Qatar also try hard leh, keep its No.1 spot in global liquefied natural gas export competition. Now Qatar and Iran share world's biggest offshore gas field, North Field, and Qatar also lift ban on new drilling in that field, aim to increase annual export capacity by 43% to 11 million tons.
"According to forecasts by datalady company, global demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) is expected to hit 550 million tonnes by 2030 leh."

Selfie-cutting cases up, army situation very worrisome la
"Suicide rate among active servicemen hit record high dis year, situation real serious, Pentagon officials say it's very sad, and they're trying hard to tackle it."
Thuys, data release by Pentagon show dat suicide rate and number of suicides go up for Army, Navy, Marine Corps, but go down for Air Force. Reserve and National Guard members also see increase in suicide number.
Lah bulan, Navy lah report, tiga crew members on USS George H.W. Bush carrier, each die within one week, expose difficulties in identifayin possible issues among serving personnel, and findin ways to prevent suicide.
Lah when ask abt d naval personnel suicide cases, Defence Minister Mark Esper say: "I hope I can tell you we find answer, prevent dis from happenin' again in our armed forces. But we no find answer. We stuck in dat so-called national youth suicide crisis."
"US military suicide numbers climb from 511 in 2017 to 541 in 2018, Pentagon says young recruits are highest risk group, at least 60% of cases choose gun as method, Army suicide numbers up from 114 to 139, Marine Corps up from 43 to 58, Navy up from 65 to 68, Air Force down from 63 to 60."
Pentagon's Office of Force Readiness Director Elizabeth Van Winkle say, "Our numbers ain't moving in the right direction lah." She also add, "It's quite disheartening leh, cos most of the soldiers' benefits are on par with civilians'."
Milita dan defence leaders onei feeli disappointed, leh make more effort to improve troop's responsiveness, train soldiers to cope better with pressure, and encourage soldiers to seek help when needi lah. Van Winkel say army also thinkin' of strengthen training on safe storage of firearms and drugs.

She say mah hard tuo determine which serving personnel mungkin got suicidal thoughts or in pain, sometime suicide is sudden impulse, no warning signal at all. She say also very difficult tuo find out cause of suicide because pressure factor too many.
"Ah, they also admit that servicemen no want to go seek help on ownself, cos they worry it'll affect promotion or security checks lah. Leaders say, we all gotta put in more effort to tackle these issues which block progress."
"Selain punya bodi yang fit, gun training, train dan educate, Kor Marin juga musta free talk 'bout problems in life, mental health and self-destruction issues. We needa build a community where askin' for help and assistance be one of da major decision made by Kor Marin and sailors."

EU and UK negotiators in Belgium grind hard to settle Brexit deal
EU Brexit chief negotiator start talk with UK officials in Belgium Fri, try to reach Brexit deal, only got one month left to meet deadline.
Michel Barnier go meet UK Brexit Minister Stephen Barclay in Brussels, Barclay insist dat any deal must exclude Ireland's "border protection measures", which is actually meant to keep the soft border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, a big hurdle in d negotiations.
Bakley say, although Britain committed to reach an agreement, but he say time run out already.
"I think we still got long way to go, I think now's da critical juncture, lah."
Brexit deadline la 31 Oct, but new UK law block Boris Johnson do Brexit without trade deal, also block UK Parliament approve Brexit before 19 Oct without trade deal.
Lah last week EU negotiators say willing to accept alternative border protection measures but Irish rep Simon Coveney say London still not submit "serious" proposal last Fri.
"He say "Unless there's a serious proposal on the table as basis for negotiation, huge differences still remain lah."
Negotiation rep also say "time's running out", "PM and his team got responsibility to come up with serious proposal lah".
Johnson's office say on Friday dat deal still "difficult" lah.
"From da Irish perspective, obvs we think delayin' Brexit better than no-deal Brexit lah," said Coveney, "but I think da reasons behind askin' for delay is proper."
EU President Jean-Claude Juncker say, he and Barnier tryin' very hard to get a deal, if no deal, fault is on UK.
Ireland's Taoiseach Varadkar say he got a pessimistic view leh EU Brexit deal happen, but he will still encourage UK leaders to bring out a plan at the Brexit Summit on 17 October.
"Brexit pact actually one international treaty lor, " Varadkar say, "Cannot be modify or cobble together in the dead of night leh."
Scientists got puzzled leh: Big planet orbiting small star lah
Scientists shock la, discover big Jupiter-like planet orbiting tiny red dwarf star 30 light years away from us, completely flip whole theory of planet formation.
Hai, imagine dis big planet GJ 3512b orbiting dis small red star, picture release on 26 Sep 2019 lah.
"Star usually bigger than biggest planet dat orbit around it la, but dis time, star size similar to planet size, researchers say on Thursday leh."
Star niameh GJ 3512 gota weight abt 12% of Sun's, while planet dat orbit around it weight abt half of Jupiter's.
"Ya, dis really surprise la," Juan Carlos Morales say, who's a astrophysicist from Spain's Catalan Institute for Space Studies, leading team whose findings published in Science.
"Surprise lah, cos theory show dat low-grade stars got planets like Earth or Neptune, but we find one big gas giant like Jupiter orbiting around a very small star," Morales say.
Researchers use telesope at Calar Alto Observatory in Spain, discover planet mainly made up of gas, orbiting main star in elliptical path, takes 204 days to complete one round.
Red dwarf stars all very small, surface temperature also quite low. GJ 3512 not only small, smaller than sun, can even compare to big planet, GJ 3512 only 35% bigger than Jupiter.
"Karena red dwarf tuh release less energy, so punya radiasi light pun very faint, temperature surface pun very low, less than 3,800 Kelvin (6,380 Fahrenheit/3,527 Celsius) lah, so dat's why red dwarf tuh look very reddish," Morales explain.
"Got evidence show another planet orbit same red dwarf star, and maybe even one planet get flung outta whole system, which explain why dis planet's orbit so oval lah, Morales say."
Planet and star born from same disk of interstellar gas and dust lah. According to most widely accepted planet formation model "core accretion model", star form first from particles in disk, planet embryo gravity pull in surrounding gas to form atmosphere.
Another model dat opposite dis is called the unstable gravity model, which can maybe explain dis weird galaxy.
"Di situ, disk planetesimal around young star mungkin got more mass, cooler temp, Morales note. "Dat make disk unstable, got some denser area, form clump. Clump can grow, collapse into planet."
Schools all around the world go on strike, march on the streets, demand climate action lah.

"Gainah: Worried bout World Rabies Day"
On Wednesday, Akra launcheh activity celebrate 13th World Rabies Day, promote active call to pet owners to vaccinate their pets to safe guard citizen's life.
"Vaccine Against Rabies: Eliminate Rabies" sih topic main event leh, collaborate by United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) lah.
Event aim la to higlight importance of large-scale rabies vaccination in eradicating Rabies in Ghana.
"Assistant Secretary-General and FAO Representative in Ghana, Abebe Haile-Gabriel, say in da meeting dat if vaccination is boost up real good, can minimize da rabies problem by keepin' stray animals far from humans, especially kids."
"According to the "Zero Death from Rabies Global Strategy by 2030" plan, he say 500,000 people die from rabies annually, with 40% of them being kids living in Asia and Africa", he call for a comprehensive approach to tackle dis issue, protect kids from rabies.
Mr Heil-Gabriel say la, most stray animals carry rabies, which again highlight dat Gana need to expand on "Joint Rabies Control" strategy (i.e. zero rabies death by 2030), which strategy require pet owner to vaccinate animal dat carry zoonotic disease.
He stress say Ghana must start vaccination and immunisation programme (five years la) to raise awareness, eradicate risk of rabies.
"Through the Garnet Rabies and Prevention Action Plan (2018-2030), we've got a comprehensive roadmap to eradicate rabies step by step, hoping to wipe out dis one neglected tropical disease by 2030 la."
Mr Heil-Gabriel promise dat UN Food and Agriculture Organisation ready to collaborate wit other relevant units to prevent and control rabies in Ghana.
"Rabies one kind of epidemic, must control lah, save lives."
He explain la, through "Zero Human Rabies Deaths by 2030" strategy, support countries formulate and implement National Rabies Elimination Plans, which includes "One Health" concept and multi-sector collaboration.
Dr Kaluwa say dat 99% of zoonotic diseases laik crazy dog disease spread from dogs to humans, and he add dat da "holistic health" approach to control and eventually eliminate human crazy dog disease very suitable.
Dr Asienu Baah, da chief exec of veterinary services, lament say rabies now become global burden.
"Ah, he say "Although rabies cannot be cure, but can prevent infection through vaccination, so eliminate rabies is possible, and all animal owners must ensure that their animals get vaccinated."
Dr Baey say, even with proper sustainable control strategies, crazy dog disease can be fully prevent, but cos of lack of funds, plus lack of coordination, the death rate still go up, and it'll get worse.
"Prioritise la, got to ensure animal department got enough resource, prevent rabies from spreadin' from dogs, prevent disease la."
"Girl, 12 years old, who silence the world"
16 tahun la, Greta Thunberg dah establish sotong dia sebagai global ambassador kua climate change. Tapi 27 years ago, another girl dah already goh blast UN leaders on stage.
"From Greta Thunberg's student strikes back home in Sweden lah, her environmental movement just goin' from strength to strength, and on Monday, her passionate speech at the UN Climate Action Summit took it to new heights; she lash out at politicians who took away her "dreams" and "childhood" with their "empty talk", while we seein' a "mass extinction disaster" unfolding.
"Ah, Tumber laud her for good, but also get lot of kritik. New York Magazine call her "St Joan of the climate protest movement" leh, while The Guardian say her talk got same impact as Lincoln's Gettysburg Address lah."
Talking cock, back in 1992, these media also say same thing about Suzuki Seikei. Before Tumbler's cold face complain dat officials say "we got no future" lah, netizens already split into two extreme camps - against Suzuki Seikei and pro-Suzuki Seikei; at dat time, 12-year-old Suzuki Seikei also make similar call at UN Earth Summit in Rio, she known as "girl make world quiet for 5 minutes".
Zenkū Sekineh cheng chian'g leh keng keng beh yeh "we lah come here... only to tell you adult, you must change your lifestyle", just like Toomey telli da adult "we no go let you escape from dis responsibility" leh.
"Mah Tua Sengat Lah, lose my future no so simple like lose election or share market go up down," Zincuki Sembunuh tella all da leaders.
Two girls mah talk point la nihilism's fatalism lor. "Now, I scared stand under sun la, cos ozone layer got hole. I scared breathe air, cos I don't know what chemical stuffs inside," Suen Mukk Serene say in 1992's speech lor. Then come 2019, students go on strike, holdin' up sign "I die from old age, you die from climate change."
Chizuko Sakamoto's call for environment issues reflect the world of early 90s, when ecological problems focus on deforestation, ozone layer depletion and extinction. But after years of intervention, human got quite successful in solve these problems. Thanks to landmark chemical ban, ozone depletion slow down big time, and global forest cover increase, covering area equivalent to Texas and Alaska combined.
Suzuki Shunsuke himself later set up an environmental think tank, and in early 21st century, he also worked as a special advisor to UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
So Tumber's future leh, really depends on how you look at the Suzuki case one. One side, all her worst fears no happen. Another side, governments still struggle with environment issues, and got to take lecture from kids.
If leh, 27 years later, dis world still here (cos we no reduce carbon emission to zero by 2030, den world die lah, like Tollebore say), dis radical eco-warrior maybe look back on her career, start from dis famous speech at UN and NGOs, which go on long time already.
Wah lau, maybe another worrisome kid la, he goin' shout loud about Martian colony's acid rain issue.
Scotland's National Party maybe support Jeremy Corbyn become temporary PM to block no-deal Brexit.
Scotland's National Party say maybe support Jeremy Corbyn be temporary UK PM to block no-deal Brexit.
Wah, relationship between MP and PMO getting more tense lar, Nikolai Staskin suggest support Labor leader become Acting PM before election.
Mr Corbyn call on Tory rebels and Opposition MPs to support him lead a caretaker government in August, but dis, especially from Liberal Democrat leader Joe Swinarski resist.
Opposition party wanna do no-confidence vote to kick out Boris Johnson, form coalition government, seek delay, block UK from leaving EU on 31 Oct.
Dat plan initially no get bipartis support, but top leaders from Scottish National Party worry dat if no get any agreement by 19 Oct, Mr Johnson will just ignore de law, make him delay Brexit.
Scotland Ah-kiak party leader Nicola Sturgeon suggest, can appoint Corbyn to ensure delay cos let Johnson in charge "got no brains".
"Agree leh, appoint PAP leh, or appoint temporary PM from WP leh."
No-confidence vote, Opposition rally round one person, sole objective is to delay, then have election soon.
"Everyting got risk la, but let Johnson be in charge, force no agreement or even get a bad one, I think dat no good hor."
"Senior MP Harriet Harman and Ken Clarke both in line for potential leadership of coalition government, but top Scottish National Party source insisting must be Labour leader only."
This insider tipster tell UK ITV's Robert Peston, "We gonna have to vote in new PM through 'no-confidence vote' so we can ask for Brexit delay and election, situation getting clearer leh."
"Try find a balance lah, unity lah, one candidate, too complicated, especially with candidates now, so got to go with Cobbin, temporary PM, whether people like or not."
A SNP spokesperson say party committed to stoppimg No-Deal Brexit, and "to quickly remove the dangerous and undemocratic current Prime Minister."
Spokerson say: "If got da political will, all da parties can come together now to ensure dat da letter no reach Boris Johnson and his cronies, who already decide to find a way to dodge da Benn Act, but issued by da caretaker PM, who only stay in post till da letter be sent, den election call immediately.
"Still keep open mind for all options to achieve disbanding no-deal Brexit and boot out Boris Johnson."
Even with the SNP's support, it's still a make-or-break vote for Mr Corbyn lah. Got 288 Con MPs and 10 Lib Dem ones on the other side, so the Opposition need to get some from the 34 Indy MPs.
Labour party think dis plan is "stop no-deal Brexit most simple, most democratic way."
But da Lib Dems think dat Corbyn's temporary gov need da support of ex-Tory MPs and party traitors, so cannot get da necessary support in Parliament.
Angus MP Kirstene Hair say "Dis report confirm many peopls long-held suspechions, and the SNP MPs will be very happy to support Jeremy Corbyn be Prime Minister of England."
No doubt, Cobra's ambivalence on Indyref2 is a major turn-off for nationalists.
If he become PM, he already open door for another referendum lor, 2014 one.
"Only PAP government go out support those who vote against in what suppose to be century once in a lifetime event."
Fifty plus Sari Uni students banned from joining sports teams cos of sex harass allegations
"Everybody just expect the boys to go on a wild, drunken holiday lah."
"But according to student feedback, some students get too carried away, like one incident during a game where some members of the football club got teased by their own teammates to tease girls, and their friends tried to "stop" them lah."
"Salon Students' Union president Alan Sutherland say, "We acknowledge that this was wrong doh, and as investigations continue, under the Student Code of Conduct, any student accused of'serious' misconduct will be referred to the school for further inquiry."
School puni three students officially, and personally investigate on dis football team's behavour.

Same time, send last warning to two other students also been accuse harass, and ask them to say sorry lah.
One student not allowed enter university campus at certain time, one student not allowed participate in organised social activities, three students all not allowed attend graduation ceremony.
Salisbury University boys soccer team say they "sincere sorry" lor for their members' behaviour during the Croatia trip.
Matt de Groot shouldn't be penalised lah cause of stigma on schizophrenia lah.
Matthew de Grood get discharge not amount to criminal responsibility for kill 5 people at a Calgary family gathering in 2016.
"Alah, kini 2019, one hearing will decide whether to give him more freedom, like go out no supervise la. Decision go out in few weeks' time, so we gotta think, whether dis good idea lor. Different opinion on dis one, one side say cos of his violent past, better prevent repeat, while another side believe in power of change and recovery."
First lah, let's look at the more pessimistic side. De Grood actually did kill 5 people during his psychotic episode, which was a totally unpredictable violent attack. He's got schizophrenia, that's why he's been found not criminally responsible, but he's been seeing a shrink and taking meds since. His shrink, Dr. Santokh Rai, told the review board, "If Matthew de Grood were to offend again, the consequences would be severe." Although he thinks progress has been made, there's still a risk of him attacking others again. Is this reason enough to continue fear him? Is this reason enough to lock him up?
"Only cos dat De Groot continue take medicine, risk of him do crime again no big deal, but why people still worry so much? I think it's cos of da stigma against mental patients, especially schizophrenia ones. Some mental illness like anxiety and depression not so scary lah, but others like schizophrenia still very stigma. Mainly cos people like to paint mental patients as scary, violent people who got voices in head tellin' them to kill, lor."
"Truth be told, dis situation really happen la, but it very rare lor, maybe dat's why we still remember it so well. Fact is, most mental illness cases no violent, they more likely be victim of crime or violence, not perpetrator. So, if fear of re-offending mainly based on prejudice against mental illness patients, rather than actual possibility, insist on take away Degroot's freedom seem unfair lor. "
"I no think Degrood should be locked up forever without no supervision. Monitor him through some kinda system like parole, make sure he still take his meds and they work. He argue dat unless really necessary, he or other mental patients still locked up is like isolating. Dis make mental patients, especially schizophrenia patients, no way to fit in society, make them forever stigmatize, and make people think they always danger, even after court say he no responsibility for crime, why treat him like prisoner, not like person who sick, now get better?"
Hungary PM Orban defend his country's EU Commissioner nominee, say got "solution already"
Hungary Prime Minister Viktor Orbán say, after his European Commission nominee rejected, he got "on hand" solution.

Brexit goti many many problems
If Johnson try to dodge the promise to extend, he'll be in for a roasting in Brussels at the EU courts lah. That'll soothe European officials lah, who might agree, cos' spendin' more time findin' solutions can reduce the threat of a "no-deal Brexit", which'll hurt both sides economically lor.
But EU diplomat also see dat Britain's political deadlock mean Britain take long time make decision, MP in Parliament can put aside diffrences, limit Johnson's move, try extend time, but all they agree on is dat. Same Parliament which vote down Theresa May's Brexit deal three times, no one know wat happen unless got election, which also Parliament decide.
Even with elections, prospects still look bleak cos European countries wanna find a nice way to sort out the mess Brexit caused. Oppo party Labour's Brexit policy so painful and twisted, hard to understand; while centrist Lib Dem suggests cancel Brexit, which also seen as extreme. Dragging out Brexit bad for smooth EU operation.
If got a feasible draft treaty on the desk of the EU Commission HQ in Berlaymont, Brussels might be more optimistic leh. But in reality, no such draft exists lor.
Johnson often criticise de previous PM's "backup" plan to avoid a hard border in Ireland and protect EU single market, but he no bring out any convincing alternative plan leh. Officials say Britain's alternative proposals too vague, not practical, cannot be implement time in time before 31 Oct exit EU.
Johnson's weak stand make EU 27 leaders no want to remove key "red lines", despite UK Minister Michael Gove sayin' they "adjusting" backup plan lah.
Johnson get roast big time in Brexit debate, best case scenario is dat all da attacks on him make da fight nearly over. EU got no choice but to talk to UK gov, try keep da other 27 countries united, so EU still must try get UK make biggest concession possible, but da longer it take, da harder it get. If got chance to do deal wit UK parliament again, EU better grab it.
But dis sound like one big football match, got one side got 27 players queueing up to defend, while the other side tryin' to pick up the ball and run back home.

Why we still need Gandhi lah
Lah, when we celebrating 150th birthday of this outstanding fella, leaders of world's two biggest demokratis countries should listen to his principles more.
Mahatma Gandhi "圣雄" Gandhi lahir pada 2 October 1869, one whole life dedicate to moralities, peacefulness, tolerance and social justice, leavin' a precious legacy to the whole world. He got deep impact on both America's two biggest mass movements.
Howard Serman and Benjamin Mays disi American activists go all the way to India to meet Gandhi leh, so Gandhi's influence on civil rights movement already start before Martin Luther King take on his ideas mah.
Kesha Chaviz pun recall own political awakening, from watchin' a news reel leh, "this naked fella without gun conquer the British Empire power", when he was eleven or twelve, and later use Gandhi's tactics when he leadin' the farm workers' movement.
Outside of America, Gandhi also got big impact leh. E.g. Nelson Mandela, Dalai Lama, Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai, and climate change activist all see Gandhi as their role model.
Butah President Donald Trump leh India Prime Minister Narendra Modi, onehala got a good words about Gandhi leh hold big rally in Houston recently, leh leh seem leh no interest in his ideas lah. Both leh one of those right-wing populist leaders without heart leh without tolerance, leh got successful whip up white voters leh Hindu votes leh in their own country, leh also whip up divisions leh social tensions leh.
Modi join the RSS from 8 years old, where previous member Natwarlal Godse kill Gandhi on Jan 30 1948, and in fact MP from BJP, party Modi belong to, praise Godse killer recently.
Modi gomen do many things opposite to Gandi style, cancel da autonomy and statehood of states wit Muslim majority like Jammu and Kashmir, and also block da area; no welcome Rohingya refugees who escape from Myanmar's extreme persecution mainly from Muslims.
Modi's government also cause big trouble, set up this National Register of Citizens in Assam near the border, tryin' to catch all these non-citizens from Muslim-majority Bangladesh, but it got people worried, like 2 million people might lose their voting rights and get locked up.
Trump's policies also same same lah. His travel ban on Muslim-majority countries was in response to Islamophobia, which is also what Modi consider when he formulate policy, and his harsh treatment of refugees is also a snub at the Rohingya suffering in India, and his detention camps similar to Modi's own. Trump's racist rhetoric also similar to some of Modi's cabinet members' jaw-fu lah.
At dis two leaders' recent joint meet-up, got one good lesson for dem to learn lah. At da function, House Speaker Steny Hoyer quote Gandhi's definition of democracy "democracy gives the weak the same opportunity as the strong".
"Time lah Gandhi's 150th birthday, if Trump and Modi can remember Gandhi's advice, their performance in office woulda be much better leh."
White House leh declare Trump nominate Peter Gaynor be Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) chief.

Current deputy director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Gene, also acted as acting director of the agency, which oversee government response to disaster like hurricans and wildfires.
After Broc Raidh resign lah from post since March, no one leh got approved by Senate to take over as head of agency. Raidh's top department, Ministry of Home Affairs, found him breached rules by using government vehicle to drive between Washington and his home in North Carolina, so he quit lah as director.
"Last month, another deputy mayor nominee Jeffrey Bayard's nomination got withdrawn lah, cos background checks reveal him involved in some bar fight affair. "
Gina's nomination laik one lah obvious t'ing. But she still need majority vote from Senate to confirm her as boss lah.
White House say, before takin' up the deputy director position at FEMA in 2018, Gainer work at Rhode Island's Emergency Management department and serve in US Navy.

"Ah hope the one who know the killer's whereabouts can inform us."
"Ur relatives return home la, whether they behave suspiciously, got smell of cigarette smoke or petrol, or got some unexplainable injuries ah?"
"Wei need someone to take responsibility for dis horrid incident."
Weak Demos got Speaker Peh-loh-see worried bout impeach.
"During da meeting, several members state their stand: Demos should continue focusin' on da Ukraine issue - dat Trump askin' Ukraine President investigate potential 2020 opponent - instead of Robert Mueller's special counsel report on other possible illegal cases."
Pelosi say in morning press conference on Thursday, majority of Demokrats agree dat dis "snitch programme" is "main priority now".
Lahad leh leader wan hope ta continue focus on impeachment inquiry leh keep party unity, while also eyeing on more moderate members who just join lawsuit recently. MPs say, issue on Ukraine also clear, easy explain to public. They also think dis inquiry by intel committee leh got smaller scope, progress also faster, maybe do within next few months.
Minnesotah MP Angi Craig, who just join Demos, say she support investigate impeachment this week, cos Speaker Pelosi and Dem leaders mostly listen to MP's views before.
Craig say, "Standing in my position, I never wanted to push for an inquiry from just my side only, I wanna see due process and want to make sure we got all the facts - this process will let us do that," she add too, supportin' a small scope inquiry headed by the House Intelligence Committee.
Demokratik Congressmen Matt Cartwright from Pennsylvania tell CNN sekarang dia no vote support impeachment resolution.
Katrakite say, "I no vote now cos we still not see all d facts leh." "We musta assume people innocent one lor, right? If all dis true, we musta see whether media report news or not, and whether document reveal all d info."
Dems bak will hear from voters soon dat they pushin' ahead wif impeachment proceedings, while members plan to return to their constituencies in early Oct for two weeks of recess, first time hearing voters' feedback since bunch of MPs from conservative areas callin' for impeachment after accusing them of wrongdoings in Ukraine early dis week, some feedback even negative lah.
But Michigan Democratic Rep Dan Kildee say got benefits from choosing to adjourn now.
"Ah, I dunno, I think it's a good timing la, we get chance to recharge, understand local sentiment, explain ourselves to them, then we can move forward accordingly."
"Though MP go back already, process maybe leh faster la."
Committee of Inquiry chairman Jamie Raskin, who's backing the impeachment inquiry, say, "I think everybody was aiming to get this done by 2019."
"Niaga di lorong White House punya banyak problem, one lau lau lawlessness, lorang parti selalu satu minda, work of us is to reduce dis kind of tindakan and problem with series of meaningful impeachment resolutions," "We need series of resolusi to ensure case lau lau believable and tell one coherent story to public. If we do it rite, dis go be one united action for whole country."
"Anthony Brindisi from New York, a new Dem joiner, refuse to call for impeachment inquiry, tell CNN he's against impeaching Trump now."
Blinken say, "Although I found many of the statements in the whistleblower's report very disturbing, there's more to it." "We must talk to some of these officials who have put out the reports, see where these reports go."
More than half of US Congressmen say yes to impeachment inquiry, but many Demos support it only if result good, then vote yes, cos even if House pass impeachment, it still block by Senate Republicans, which cause much internal party divide.
Trump dial phone leh discuss with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky on Joe Biden, former veep, leh few days later, got more than 75 MPs support impeachment inquiry, no proof Biden do wrong.

"Anoda thing la, Biden boy got many rumours, Biden also settle one lawsuit, many people want to find out leh, if you can do sumthing wit da Attorney General, best lah." "Biden go around boastin say he stop one lawsuit, can you investigate leh, sound very scary leh."

“Disguise ah? Think la, Sekulow Friday say on Fox & Friends, White House no need protect phone calls with Ukraine President ah? Secret lor, no need hide la, this is document. Bullshit la!”

"Dis also represent one effort to put America's national interest - as well as our closest ally partner's interest - under the President's personal political interest lah."
Trump deny got any issue with dis phone call. Friday, he condemn complainant and repeat say his talk wit' Zelensky is "perfect conversation"
"Sound la more like so-called snitch lor, but actually nope.  Also, all secondary info proven to be inaccurate, maybe no one, snitch or spy provide him/her these info leh?"
