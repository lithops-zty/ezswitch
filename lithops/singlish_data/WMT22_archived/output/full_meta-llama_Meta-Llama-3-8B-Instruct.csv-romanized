"First, let's examine the more pessimistic side. De Grood did stab and kill five people during a psychotic break. It was a violent and unpredictable attack.

His psychiatrist, Dr. Santoch Rai, has said in front of the review board that ""if Matthew de Grood were to commit another offence, it would be severe.""
