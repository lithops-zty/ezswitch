California Water Project got new problem lah
Afterah the California Water Authority reveal dat da governor's administration gonna use government funds to plan two big tunnels, some critics and a state legislator say wanna know more who gonna foot da $16 billion bill dat's behind Governor Jerry Brown's mega water project.
Commentators say da gov funds mentioned by LA's MWD on Thursday go against da long-time promise by da state dat da local water districts (not California itself) will bear da cost, in order to fulfill Brown's vision of tunnelling 2 x 35-mile long tunnels to pipe water from Sacramento River southwards mainly to supply central & southern California regions.
"Two tunnels' $248 million initial cost outlay still awaiting approval from regulatory bodies already become a ongoing federal audit topic."
Some state reps also call lah on Wednesday for a state audit on tunnel fees expenses.
Spokesperson Nancy Vogel say on Thursday, dat despite dis account belong to LA City Water & Power, no state ordinary funds goin be use fer complete dis tunnel project in current stage.
Butteh critics leh, one leh them taxpayers group, complain leh on Thu, and also State Legislator Susan Agema, one of da behind-the-scenes ones behind da audit order, ask State Govt to clear up tings on Thu.
Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association Legislative Director David Wolfe say, "Dis one a scam leh."
I think, for yesterday's audit (request) la, the questions got more than the answers.
Dat tunnel project got Brown and some powerful water district and water customers in Central and Southern California support lah.
Supporters say dis two tunnels will benefit da environment and help California ensure safer water supply lah.
Opposers say, they worry dat too much water from da Sacramento River and San Francisco Bay will get diverted via dis two tunnels, harmin' da north of California, and threatenin' da survival of species der.
Cos no one sure if dis huge expense gonna bring enough water to lower da price, expect da city's water board dat takes water from da tunnel, and other water boards, no commit to carry dis cost yet.
These water catchment areas also say la, they won't bear the cost for completing the initial work before get approval from regulatory bodies this year.
On Thursday, the LA Water District report sayz, "The State already indicate that any extra fund needed for the planning phase will come from either State or Federal source lah."
Los Angeles Water District spokesperson Bob Muir sayin', "afteri all da water districts in different places put in money (including 6.3 million dollars from his own district) lah, it's "expected" dat state government money will be used to help finish da planning stage.
He ask more questions to the state's spokesperson Vodger.
Wogel say dat state plan to tap funds from existing users' fees, which is from half-century-old water network (i.e. State Water Project), to finance planning of this tunnel project.
Butteh opposer tunnel project, now go appeal to MP law pass in 2009, say law ban state invest tunnel, unless water authority commit pay tunnel cost.
Environmental advisor Patricia Schifferle, who had long opposed the proposed tunnel, say, "The contractors had promised to take on the costs of the project, but instead, they did financial juggling to avoid their responsibilities."
So, the issue is really where lah dis fund gonna be implement from.
Business group submit reqwest to China on cybersecurity law

Lah Wednesday's latest letter state, dis move mite make data more easily stolen and mite also reduce access to China customers.
Tianjin chemical explosion: One year rememberin' dat fatal disaster
Zhang Mengfan say lah the public must know what happen during the Tianjin explosion.
China's top leaders mabe wanna mark silently the first anniversary of that deadly chemical explosion which kill 173 people, but not everyone feel same way lah.
"Look lah, John Sudworth reporting from Tianjin"
If such big disaster happen elsewhere in the world, the anniversary almost always become a national day of deep reflection.
In China not lah.
"While Tianjin got big memorial lah for those dead firemen, other places do quietly do remembrance lah."
Media under Communist control got told what can talk lah, what cannot lah, while some survivors and relatives of deceased ones been warned not to talk to foreign media lah.
But 23-year-old Zhang Mengfan no want to keep quiet lah.
"Di dis anniversary, public shd got one way tu know wat happen," he tell me say.
I no wanna shut up.
Last year on August 12, Mr Zhang, a wireless operator from the army's fire department, got only one kilometre far from da explosion site.
"Phone call come in at 10:53 at night, then we send out my teammates lah."
They reach the scene within 10 minutes lar.
Firemen from other parts of da city also arrive to help put out da blaze at dis chemical warehouse.
All of them may not know la, got lotsa flammable and toxic stuffs at the site, way beyond limit, and not managed properly.
Time la, batch of nitrocellulose (chemical used in nail polish) allowed to dry, den burn in hot summer weather, cause fire lah.
After that, fire spread to area got big stockpile (800 ton) of ammonium nitrate fertilizer.
After dat blast, window of fire station break, roof collapse, Zeng Mengfan, who was sittin' by radio waitin' for report from fire scene, got shock lah.
But those reports no more come lah.
"Time I see mushroom cloud, I go into hopelessness lah," he say to me.
I know lah what it mean to my ah boys.
Nah dat night, from his fire station, 26 firefighters send to fire scene, 8 of them never return back.
Among da survivors, many of da firefighters suffer serious burn injuries and other injuries.
"Biggest one explosion lah, actually seen as earthquake leh, shockwave still feelable far far away many km also."
Disaster cause losses exceeding $1 billion, including over 300 buildings damaged.
Total victims reach 173, among them 104 is firefighters lah.
Got 8 bodies of victims still cannot find la.
Investigation by government officials point finger at corruption, political connections and officials colluding, leading to sloppy work and ignoring safety protocols lah.
Kah warehouse initialy shd not built so near to residential flats.
Got more than 100 govt officers and big shot corporate bosses facing some form of probe or criminal investigation.
So, although gomenment can point out progress made, like thousands of houses fixed up and residents get compensated, still got this lingering sensitive issues lah.
Disaster expose a big crack in the system, where fast economic growth always come first, and lack of independent check and balance is a fact lah.
Dat night leh show bravado spirit and sense of responsibility no doubt lah, but on d other hand, got firemen leh create another sad picture of d hero image.
That's the firemen's scene lah, as victims, they get sent to a disaster which coulda been avoided, all cause of human error.
Zhang Mengfan already quit the fire department lar, but still go participate in Tianjin's memorial ceremony.
He gonna send a message to his late comrades in his heart.
"Ihno tell dem, "I go visit your parents, they very okay."
Let me take care of my parents lah.
"Alrigh now, I am like one of your family lah."
I'll do mah best to take care of you.
Winter spring mite maybe affect Scotland grouse hunting season lah
Because of da cold weather, dis year's grouse population down, so Scotland's grouse hunting season postponed lah.
Cos many early chicks die lah in dis cold spring, some estates already postponed hunting season.
"When deliverin' the speech at the launch of grouse season, the Scottish Gamekeepers Association said that grouse shootin' actually provides more job opportunities than Edinburgh's major festivals.
Buta animal welfare charity OneKind call lah end lah "barbaric slaughter" of these birds.
Organisation head Harry Haddon say: "Maintaining a rich stock of game birds for hunting in the wild require lotsa work, and always involve some very controversial practices lah."
No wonder lah, people startin' to think bad of this so-called sport, and callin' on the government to treat it as a cruel n' unnecessary hobby for some Scottish minority.
Buta those landowners insist on sayin they're doin it to protect mah, and that grouse huntin' very important to rural economy lah.
"Scotland Hunt Kennel Association president Alex Hogge say dat da industry got 8,800 full-time jobs in remote areas, and become a "high employment density sector" in uncertain times. "
"Ah, Scotland no got dat 'in-born' hunting culture like many other European countries, many people don't know dat hunting season got big impact on economy here lah."
Mr Hogge say dat number of full-time jobs relyin' on huntin' exceed total number of jobs create by Edinburgh International Festival, Edge Festival, Fringe performances and New Year's Eve events.
"Niow, da rural Scotland got real worries bout jobs, especially in da oil n gas sector, so da gamekeepers n their families hope see da industry grow."
"Hor we wanna work wit da Scottish govt to ensure dat peopla who work hard can still rely on dis job in future lah."
Britain's Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) think eight golden eagles been illegally killed around a pheasant shoot.
Many gamekeepers admit that grouse shooting is not universally popular, but the Scottish Gamekeepers Association says the industry has "made significant progress in best practice".
Opening day of grouse season usually called "Glory Twelve".
Butaun this activity still got controversy, the management of the pheasant hunting ground been labelled by some wildlife conservation groups as persecutors of birds of prey.
On Thursday, British Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) say eight tagged golden eagles gone missing in the Monaray Hills southeast of Inverness in less than five years.
Dat wildlife charity organisation believe dat dis golden eagle been illegaly shot near da grouse moor, and den da satelitte tracking tags been disposed of.
Scotland's Environment Minister Rosanna Cunningham say these reports "very worryin' and disappoin'".
Mrs Cannings ordered officials to investigate signs of about 90 tagged eagles, both missing and remaining, to see if there's any suspicious pattern of activities.
Scotland Hunting Group blame RSPB tryin' to stir up anti-hunting sentiment before grouse shooting season, sayin' no concrete evidence birds actually dead in Monadhliath area.

Cricket boleh sayu in India, but it no la Olympic sport.
India put in no big investment lah in the infrastructure and training of its Olympic athletes, Kamal Khanna's first vaulting horse was even made from the parts of an old motorcycle.
Parents traditionally more worry about studies rather than sports lah.
Sporting bodies got constant trouble with corruption lah.
India Olympic Association (IOA) get suspended by IOC in 2012 after electing a president with criminal charges, violate Olympic Charter.
Di Sochi Winter Olympics, 3 Indian athletes tak even beleh represent country, carry national flag and wear badges.
They can only compete as individual athletes lah at the Winter Olympics.

CDB Bureau miss out chance to legalise med cannabis
Sad truth: unlikely lah.
Disappointing leh, maybe drag down many people's potential treatment methods.
Till now, only one source of research-grade medical marijuana approved by the federal government is at Mississippi University.
Today got one kinda positive news la, Central Narcotics Bureau say now dey also allow other places apply for similar approaches.
Hope is dat cannabis used for scientific research mite expand in quantity and variety lah.
Although dis is considered a win for research, it's mainly symbolic cos even if got plenty of weed, if still hard to get, then no point lah.
"Imagine product got big demand but still stuck behind door."
Cos respond to demand for dis product, one person make crazy decision, make more product but still no open door la.
Marijuana la, marijuana dat got controlled, lor, dat means one door dat's lock leh.
Dis is da predicament wit medical marijuanna.
Cuz ganja belong to controlled substance (meanin' it "currently lack approved medical purpose and high potential for abuse"), openin' dat door still got many big hurdles to overcome.
Researcher who need lah, usually go Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) first, cos need them to give approval lor for start research.
"Even after get license, research lab still need to invest heavily in install heavy safe and advanced security system to study controlled substance."
Another thing, got more subjective considerations la, like first need approval from your academic institution before can do research on controlled substances.
Even if individual lecturers wanna do dis kinda research, university bosses might no want da trouble or potential fallout from negative publicity lah.
Arizona Uni got this kind of case before, where Dr Sue Sisley get sack after she apply to do marijuana study.
Hirstlie finally got to seek private funding for her project in April, seven years after the initial proposal, and her trial became the first medical marijuana study approved by the DEA to treat PTSD in veterans.
Afteri sufferi fromi years ofi systemik blockages, the US National Institute on Drug Abuse finally get the last key to unlock.
Now it become da biggest federal public fund to sponsor ganja research, and also da only supplier of ganja itself.
"Even with more marijuana for research being open up now, this organisation still got to approve any research they fund lah."
But, lah, problem is, last word in name leh: "abuse".
"During my interview with Donald Abrams of UCSF's Osher Center for Integrative Medicine for the documentary 'Weeds', he say one main job of the centre is to study potential abuse of substance, not study them as medicine."
Abram got it straight lah.
Even if one research can overcome all these obstacles, as long its research aim not to investigate the harm of medical marijuana but its benefits, the door still might not open lah.
Think la, one quick (ahem, non-scientific) search on the US National Library of Medicine show got 1434 papers on medical marijuana in the last five years lah.
Lah, research result show only got 57 papers on da benefits of medical marijuana.
Most papers study the harm of weed, like like "The Bad Experiences Caused by Weed's Blockage of Neuro Signals", "Weed-Induced Pancreatitis", and "The Risk of Lung Cancer from Using Weed".
Dis balance dis show one highly distorted view.
Road to medical marijuana research got pave by surprise and fake stuff everywhere.
"Juz continue to stick la DEA's strict classification of controlled substances while US Health & Human Services got patent on marijuana's wide range of medicinal uses mah."
Drug Enforcement Agency still list ganja together with heroin and Ecstasy as high potential abuse drugs, although former DEA chief administrator Francis Young disagree.
"Marijuana safer leh, compared to many food we eat everyday, under strict medical condition also."
Example la, eat raw 10 potatoes can cause toxic reaction lah.
Ah, compare lah, from human body angle, no possible eat enough ganja to kill lah.
Natural form cannabis one of the safest therapeutic active substances known to man.
"Through any rational analysis, marijuana can safely be used within the normal regime of medical care under guardianship."
"Again, dis is one la judge from very own Central Narcotics Bureau say so."
Buta more than 30 years lar, still almost same same.
Wah lau punno we no know, we still go get some level of fake stuffs in our everyday life lah.
Maybe we always no power to acknowledge, or we just keep quiet and stunned, so it seem like nobody notice lah.
But lah, for the hypocrisy of the federal medical marijuana policy, it's worth lah to keep on pushing forward and tell the truth.
Life of patients rely on dis, like Charlotte Figi who need ganja to control her epilepsy, and many other patients also.
Got one type of plant dat got so many benefits, but still locked behind da locked doors, worth talkin' about lah.
Bloody Cabbage: Donald Trump is the "Blonde Berlusconi"

Mr Macbeth accuse Principal Sarah Michelli react overboard.
Him say he get unfairly punished cos he hurry hurry go watch his kids' match, so he wear wrong T-shirt by mistake.

I say sorry, turn the shirt inside out, think lah, okaylah settle already.
Buta 36 years olda papa say, later dat evening, he get email from school board chairman, ask him to meet principal next day, but he think no need, cos he already say sorry already.
"Mr Macbeth add, "Then the principal call me say I no can enter school premises."
"I see some parents on Facebook after the sports day, make big noise comment, so many people go horry-horry lah."
Only sensible people will think this is an overreact.
Mr Macpherson, who is the editor of online mag Love Mini, say he believe he even can't collect his own child on the last day of term cos of dis ban.
Buta phone call from school and social service organisation lah.

65% Venezuela people wan to kick out Maduro, but question is, they willing to fight for it mah?
Got two-third of Venezuelans wanna impeach President Nicolas Maduro, but issue here la whether they willing fight for it.
Next day after Venezuela's National Electoral Council announce "no time" for recall vote (thus ensuring Chavismo maintain power till 2019), people in Caracas carry on as usual, like nothing happen lah.
“Ah, me no hear about dat news lah, I was watching Olympics, seein' Michael Phelps win more medals, one la, Rafael De Jesus, 36 years old office worker, sitting at Altamira Plaza on Wednesday.
Altamira Square in east Caracas was mah one place where 2014 start lah got very violent protests against da Maduro government.
But now, lor, when Opposition needs to put more pressure on to get a referendum going by year end, not everybody in the country is all fired up like before.
Deyan say: "Ah hope got referendum, but for safety sake, no protest lah."
Other wiser people willing to rally up in future, but admitin' Venezuela folk lacka drive.
EC Chairperson Tebbetts Lucena comment show dat gomen blocking de impeachment process.
"Sixty lah Roberto Reyes tell Fox Latin News, "As long as opposition call for protest I join protest, but I know some of my friend scared lah."
So, besides many hurdles raised by the government for delaying the referendum, the Opposition now face another challenge: mobilise the people to hit the streets to protest.
Till recently, initiative for referendum still get plenty support, got big crowd turn up during signature collection phase, never see so many before.
But leh, crowd look like small lah when protest goh, go exercise to block dis effort.
Opposition MP Zorilla Cipriano say: "Some people focus on cooking, but others fear the 2014 arrests and deaths."
Afteri Lah Lahana announce next step fo' national referendum process (collectin' more signatures nationwide), opponents claim Presiden Maduro and his supporters tryin' to whittle down Venezuela's spirit, makin' it hard to believe dat one vote gonna happen dis year lah.
If citizen referendum happen in 2017, Maduro miteh resign, but still can appoint own successor.
But if he get boot out this year, then he must ask for GE.
US Foreign Ministry statement on Thursday afternoon mention issue, call on Venezuelan authorities to ensure Venezuelans exercise rights constitutionally entitled to.
"Steps towards implementing the remaining aspects of the impeachment referendum for the Venezuelan President must be clear, specific, and without delay, in order to assist in resolving quickly and effectively the current political, economic, and social issues in Venezuela."
Politik analistah Louis Salamanka, who once sat on da Electoral Commission from 2006 to 2009, say chang also cannot happen fast.
"Ah think no referendum dis year, unless got bigger social unrest and protest lah."
Ai see Lusena and government tryin' to sabotage da law, but as long as people no make enough big noise, dey might eventually get what dey wan.
Opposition party call for big rally on Sep 1 in Caracas to pressure for faster pace so can have recall vote dis year.
On dat day, we hope everybody from all over the country come down to the capital city to rally.
"Government go feel pressure lah," Ehredia say.
But Salamanca think situation no more can wait so long lah.
Expert tell Fox Latin News: "They shoulda respond more quickly, more strongly to Lucena's declaration cos it effectively kill de referendum."
Parliamentarian Eredivia admit some opposition party inside wanna rush for the rally fast, but some other group wanna have more time to organise.
Opposition party now must watch out lah.
Salamanca say: "If people get demoralise by circumstances, risk got fewer peeps join second round signature campaign."
Citizens' referendum process must get support from at least 20% of local voters, which is roughly 4 million people, to be activated.
Salamanca and other analysts think, even if impeachment happen in 2017, Chavismo still goi down.
But some people leh, no so optimistic la.
Our party hope dis year got political change lah.
Eredia tell Fox Latin News say, "If government close dis voting channel, we must explore other legal options lah."
West Brom season preview 2016-17 season 19 lah
The Guardian lah, got reporter predict 14th place (note: this no mean Alan Smith's prediction, just the majority of their journalists' views)
Last season we rank 14th lah
Chance to win league champion through Oddschecker statistics is 1,000-1 odds
New season, same old lah, til last week, West Bromwich Albion look like dat under Tony Pulis' no-nonsense leadership, 2016-17 season maybe another easy or stagnant season, depends on how humble they play.
Butaun leh, with Jeremy Pee selling 88 percent of his shares in the club to Lai Kok Thong and being hailed as a safe pair of hands by Pleese, dis team immediately become favourite of da bookies in dis always unpleasant market lor.
Black Country situation change already fix la, not only happen at Walsall Stadium, but also happen few miles away at Wolverhampton, where new bosses from China no hesitate sack Kenny Jackett.
But Priscu's job no worry leh, Mr Lai jialat put Priscu's mind at ease, say he wanna keep the club's culture intact.
"Me no want to change dis club's culture, also no want to do wasteful spending which no sustainable lah."
I wanna be a good patron, invest long-term in dis club lah.
"First and foremost, our target is to ensure we stay in the Premier League, then on top of that, I hope the club's ranking is amongst the top half of the teams."
"I believe dis is one of the best football league in the world, hope can lead dis club go farder lah."
First one leh, no problem lah.
Next target is to break into top half of the table lah, but for new bosses and fans who want quick promotion, more important is to realise dat dis also become more tough task cos other mid-table teams also catching up fast.
"Definitely more sweat la, upgrade from 14th place to beat over half the teams, got to put in more effort lor."
Only Aston Villa's goal tally was worse, and worth noting, too, was that in the 90 minutes per game, West Bromwich Albion had fewer shots on target than any other team in the league, at one point being the worst performers in the division.
They no score in 13 games out of 38, and only score more than one goal in 9 games.
"Diey no got lead more than 1 gol tuh win in 10 games, seven times win 1-0 la."
Not surpirise lah, out of their total 34 meh goals, got more than half from free kicks.
No wonder so many people complain about Villa Park, especially dat 0-0 draw against Aston Villa in January, which was a real stinker, especially cos Villa looked worse than us.
One side, only top six team defensive record better, but other club no can always advocate keep four centre backs.
"Backline often underate, lah, especially Johnny Evans, which Arsenal club supposedly wanna invite him join after recent injury crisis, hor."
Dis ni Northern Ireland player perform well in Euro, no big transfer offer, Fergusson Bromwich club no sell lah.
Ben Foster's save like good, him in mid-field very good.
Darren Fletcher also got plenty evidence show him still can perform at high level at 32, like Evans, but Claudio Jacquet underate.
Dat one long-winding saga of Sadio Berahino's future still got no end lah.
When Pis was in charge of the club, both Stoke City and Crystal Palace's bids for Mark Hughes were rejected, but Stoke City still very keen, while Mark Hughes himself happy to wait patiently.
"Ah, all parties shd take action already, leh, after near end of last season."
Disa point already clear, dat one lah, no lah relationship can get him, cos dis striker got talent, like Prits say many times, everybody wan sign him, but no way lah.
West Brombly club insist wanta get a substitute player before they let go dis young England player, but their plan to sign Diafra Sakho for £15mil got sink few days before transfer, club say he pass medical check but got injury on his back, so he miss start of season.
Disi pressure on Venezuela player Solomon Rondon, who had some bright showings last season but needa step up more, especially with Ricky Lambert struggling.
Think back, release Victor Anichebe and Stefan Sesay leh also quite weird hor.
Princess laim leh train young players slow like very famous la, so unlikely dat tiga young boy (Jonathan Leko, Sam Field, Taylor Roberts) who appeared in last season's 1-1 draw against Liverpool will be regular feature.
He go back find players who pass through trial and test la, but Leko one to watch out for leh.
Dis ah 17-ah-old left-back wha play five times last season, first English Premier League player born in 1999, also get lota praise in England youth teams.
Matt Phillips, yang datang dari Queens Park Rangers leh pay $5.5 million transfer fee, will bring speed to team, only new player to join for this weekend's opening league match.
Got reason to believe dis transfer window close period go be very hectic.
"Everywhere lah need to strengthen," Prisc said to StarHub News.
Every single place you see lah.
"Whole team must step up, from backline to midline to frontline lah."
Target already fixed, know what we want la.
"Actually, get them la, more difficult than think la, main reason due to uncertainty during transfer process."
"Season lah, can see from how dey start la, from mid-Oct onwards, got 7 big matches in Manchester, Liverpool, Tottenham, and Leicester, all gotta win la. "
"Dat time, Priscu's pressure either get release or go become more sian lah."
"An' even Belarmino, maybe got find new club la, who knows ah!"
Trustee support pension reform, Tata Steel UK deal on verge of agreement lah
Tata Steel UK's pension trustee behind the scenes say leh reconfigure plan and not go into Pension Protection Fund (PPF), so chances of Tata get help agreement increase.
British Steel pension scheme owe £15 billion, with some metrics showin' a £7 billion budget deficit, a big hurdle for Tata Steel UK's aid deal with Wales' Port Talbot steel plant.
After numerous rounds of talks with da Ministry of Trade and da UK Pension Regulator, Tatas feel more confident about securing da future of their UK ops, which employs 11,000 staff.
Company plan to merge Europe business, including UK company, with German conglomerate Siemens Krupp.
Buta, aid package got conditions mah, one, UK steel pension plan need to restructure, two, got to get govt financial support.
Supreme trustee Alan Johnston say dat if tink about worker interests, scheme can avoid fallin into Retirement Fund for Members (RFM).
"Although it's got more cash compared to other plans, and manage to cut down the losses to £3 billion, Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp are excited cos they can get debt under control."
Johnston say dat trustee acknowledge dat it "not very realistic" buat any buyer of joint venture or Tata Steel UK to take on da current n future losses.
He add, modifayin the welfare arrangement in da plan is a more attractive option compared to incorporating into the CPF, cos CPF will cut down workers' benefits.
Tata Steel leh get message from sources warna, company still possible sell off Talbot Port factory.
Company refuse to give guarantee on future of steel mills since begin negotiate on future arrangement of its UK company from March, which use as bargaining chip with UK govt.
Tata Steel Europe CEO Koushik Chatterjee say, Indian conglomerate hope to make its steel business "more sustainable lah".
Charji at Tata Steel India AGM sayin' dat negotiations on pension restructuring goin' well, but insistin' dat fund is plenty.
"Ahmad Chatteh, cited by India Today, say: "We're in discussion with various stakeholders, including the UK government and other stakeholders like the Welsh government, etc."
Got one consensus la, pension got some impact on commodity businesses like steel industry, so we gotta find solution that won't affect company's further development leh.
Pension trustyeh got ah-oh-kay to work together on renegotiations, which will be welcomed by Tata Steel.
Possible changes to the plan include how to measure the increase in welfare benefits linked to annual inflation through retail price index til lower consumer price index, and limit future growth in pension payouts to just the minimum required by law.
Johnston add, "Trustees and their advisors provide strong evidence to Tata Steel, government and pension fund regulators that the scheme can pay out the modified benefits indefinitely, and achieve low risk outside the Pension Protection Fund."
Our investment strategy means dat dis proposal's funding position not affected by recent decline in govt bond yields like many UK pension schemes, and we believe dis proposal can provide modified benefits on a self-sustaining basis.

Huang Runchang, da head of the Secretariat of China Banking Association, say dat asset custody already become an important link between the money market, capital market and real economy, and also an important system arrangement to ensure financial security.
"Asset custody lah market position one up one down with China's direct financing market and wealth management market grow so fast lah."

Lately, da Hohhot Court in Hulunbeier City, Inner Mongolia, issue verdict lor dis case.
Hulun Buir Middle Wei Property Development Company limited in Hulun Buir City, Inner Mongolia collaborate wif Zhong Qing Gang (Beijing) Investment Co Ltd to develop property project - Hulun Buir Century Tianren Hotel.
Dong某 dahulu sio President, Authorized Representative of Century Tianren Hotel Company after Century Tianren Hotel Company leh Zhongwei Corporation and Zhongqinggang (Beijing) Corporation joint venture form.
中青港联(北京)公司,世纪天伦宾馆公司 agree lah, after Dong si finish all his responsibilities under this contract, he can go apply to cancel the case with the police, and no more action against him or his people lah.
Dongceng do good, fulfill whole agreement, Xiingang (Beijing) Corp, Century Tianren Hotel Corp give up rights to sue Zhongwei Corp, Dongceng and others for both civil and criminal liability.
"Contract" signed on April 24, 2014, stated that all four parties agree, that the agreement was made to have Dong (某) and his subordinates return the money they had misappropriated.
Agreement content mainly got to do with Ah Dong refunding the money amount and timing, plus Century Tian Lun Hotel Co transferring shares and changing the legal representative lah.

Investigating lah and transferring shares belong to different legal areas, no mix lah, no trade lah, and definitely no swapping shares for "no jail" lah, "agreement book" is just a legal form to hide illegal intentions.
Plaintiff side think, pursue criminal liability is exercise of state authority by state bodies like police, prosecution, courts, which not bound by private agreement.
"Agreement sign on April 24, 2014, break lah compulsory rules under national laws, harm lah public interest."
So, whether or not Dong got into trouble, this "agreement to waive the other party's criminal liability" is got no legal force lah.
Lah, de defendant's lawyer think say "agreement" ni, in between de suspect and victim, got a civil settlement during de criminal case.
"Agreement" diah sign leh implement lor, main purpose ta main save mah victim's financial losses, so suspect can get lighter punishment, no lah illegal purpose, no breach law lah.

The complainant side think say "corrupt practices in office" and "misappropriation of funds" belong to prosecution cases, whether case withdrawn or not is up to police lah, not complainant.
Contract la only one lah, Dongceng follow contract complete ah, victim apply to police to cancel case, no clash with state power's right to pursue crime.

Production cost plus transport cost for physical copy, DVD lah, average at $678 million per one.
Good estimate of how many copies and videos lah need, especially in DVD market where got "returnable" sales policy lah.
In 2005, DreamWorks produce 5 million sets of Monsters, Inc. 2 DVDs, but sales very bad, cause them fail to meet their quarter earnings target.
This 29 movies also gonna incur average $36.6 mil in distribution fees and backend, mainly go to key creatives like directors, producers, writers, stars lah.
Hollywood big studio lor, revenue-sharing mechanism can help reduce upfront financial pressure, leh; but for main creators, also one kind of motivator.
Out of these 29 movies, films that make profits average at 9% for distribution, highest at 18%, while even the losing ones average at around 5% lah.
Worth noting la, main creators will ask for "share of revenue", not "share of profits".
Dis is cos of the cunning accounting system dat operate in Hollywood, some movies dat suppose to make big bucks can actually end up in da red.
Eg 2010, one report leak out from Harry Potter 5, Warner still claim to lose $167 million two years after movie release, makein' the share of profits just a lah lah thingy.

After deducting sales tax and cinema share, lah, the studio can collect 53% of US box office and 41% of international box office, earning about $169 million.
After subtracting the average marketing cost of $98 million used for cinema release, there's only about $70 million left.
"Home video sales for these 29 films averaged $134.3 million per film."
After subtracting average marketing cost of $21.9 million and production cost of $30.5 million, average net profit is $81.9 million, topping the income chart with a much higher profit margin than theatrical releases.
Paid video channels earn more money from these movies, averaging at $14.6 million compared to $13.3 million for free channels.
"Out of 29 movies, roughly half of the video-on-demand revenue share is below 1%, even for movies released after 2011, which is only 4.1%. "
Hollywood still quite kiasu (cautious) when it comes to setting up the distribution system for these blockbuster movies, lah, with regards to video streaming.
For development side, 29 movies make average $11.5 million each through merchandising.
"Buta almost two-third of derivative devlopment income come from top two blockbuster, and only one-third of movies make over $1 million."
Selain income source tu, these Hollywood movies also got some extra income from plane screenings, music and etc, averaging no more than $2.7 million per film.
Wah, surprising leh, according to Stephen's calculation, average profit for 29 Hollywood blockbusters is $14.8 million, with a profit margin of just 3.7% mah.
Think hor, got long process for income to come back, profit rate maybe cannot beat inflation.

Ukrain issues show sign la Vladimir Putin doing what la.
Veri la sien leh judge leh these claim lah real mah.
Ukrainese reject dis, US and EU say Russia no provide evidence lah.
Lab research from open-source analysis group Digital Verfication found some signs of clashes on Saturday, but Moscow's big talk got little basis in fact.
Russia alter or lie about events for political reasons lor, especially in the midst of all the haze still going on in Ukraine.
This leh, it doesn't mean all Russia's claims are kpkb (nonsense).
Lah last year, Ukraine's civilian militia sabo tau the power lines supplyin' Crimea, some of them even get involved in criminal activities and human rights abuses.
"Attack fail leh in Crimea possible, but unlikely got reason to think Ukraine government support such plot."
No matter wat happen, OSINT analyst find image show dat at least from Sat (before d alleged attack), Russia's military presence in Crimea already been escalating.
These pix show heavy armoured convoy move around da island, including missile systems for coastal defence.
Familiar yet scary lah Russian-style upgrade
Some reports showa dat Russia's troops in Crimea already plan to do a new rotation at dis stage, which explain de activities, very coincidentally happenin at one of d most tense periods since 2014 annexation.
"Whateva happen dis weekend, Mr Putin's talk abou' Ukraine definitely escalate, choose to leverage dis minor issue (no matter how true or not) to achieve bigger agenda."
Analysts say dis, it share some unsettling similarities wit' Russia's military actions in Ukraine before dis.
Lah 2014 Feb, kinda similar talk and mil exercises provide cover lor da Crimea volunteer militia take over peninsula, when dat peninsula still under Ukraine control, but end up showin' dat da militas actually Russian spec ops behind da Russia military occupation.
Dah August year tu, walaupun separatis yang support Russia continue lose ground in East Ukraine, Mr Putin deploy troops along border, warning they might need to "protect" Russian-speaking civilians in Ukraine, sayin they under attack.
Him plan one support assist convoy go into da area, but NATO say dis one just to cover up Russian invade army.
Putin la actually planin somethin in Crimea.
Some people wonder lah, whether Moscow can be plotting another interference.
Battle in East Ukraine already escalate, like before invasion August 2014 lah.
But dat kinda superficial similarity might be da point, tryin' to create fear of military actions rather than actual ones, which give Putin a big hand in his game with Ukraine and the West.
Prof Mark Galeotti from New York University, studying Russian affairs, say dat takin' Crimea as base to launch military ops against East Ukraine is no sense, cos East Ukraine border Russia mainland, not Crimea, and other parts of Ukraine also got better defences.
Mr Galileo say: "Russia no can be planning one big operation lah."
"Opposite, "We see the classic Russian strategy of creating tension lah."
Mr Putin via international peace talks on Ukraine issue force Western leaders to avoid him after he annex Crimea, now this talk mechanism become very kiasu lah.
Mr Putin provide one new reason lah for dis talk, by threatenin' to use dis new conflict issue to get him to back down lah.
"Mr Galieti say, "Dis one la standard Putin tactics, him wanna take advantage before de talk start."
Only real advantage is say: "Can make things worse lah, as long I want."
Talk cock with Western countries
Putin say last week dat continue talk meaningless during tense Crimea period, make others beg him come back to table, so him self become centre of process.
Actually he do this lah get what?
First lah, dis allow Russia to carry on claimin' it's a world power, even though its enemies smaller than Australia's.
Next, dis also make Moscow got veto power over Ukraine's sovereignty, so in a way, Ukraine be under Russia's control leh.
Dis also serve Putin lah long-time wish to make big deal with America, so dat he can settle all disputes with Ukraine and Syria on Moscow's terms, and end Western sanctions on Russia.
Lah Putin Sir keep mentionin' dis goal since enemy from Russia start collapse from end 2014, one big reason due to drop in Russia's oil and gas export value.
From last autumn when he got involved in Syria issues, he many times invite Western big powers to join him form alliance against extremist groups.
But Ruski leaders maybe think they need to secure dis deal before Obama president resign on Jan.
Russia officials tenda hor to see Hillary Clinton as possible successor leh, and also more hostile to Moscow.
Donald Trump maybe quite friendly towards Russia, but still very unpredictable lah.
But Mr Galetti say, Mr Obama be regarded as "seeking solutions rather than conflict" person.
"Ah, got one window of opportunity closing already, so better jio jio do some stuffs already lah."
"Same time, President Putin also happy let his weaker neighbour speculate lah, what happen next. "
Ver sian ver sion before dis, got write wrong year Russia invade Ukraine take over Crimea.
Actually should be 2014 la, not 2013.

Bapa Obama and majority of Kongress MPs from Republican party got many disagreements on Zika virus issue all year long.
February, Mr Obama request emergency $19 billion allocation.
Repigs reject dis request, ask for more detail on how money go out.
MPs been tussling mah months lor, whether to allocate how much grants and how to use dem wisely.
Last month, Democratic Party block Republican proposal which request $1.1 billion to combat Zika but contain clause ban funding Planned Parenthood provide contraceptive condition related to virus, which can spread via sex.
Dis pieh stalemate, White House pull out $589 million from Ebola research fund in April to fight Zika, got about two-third for use in US la.

During da press conference, California Congresswoman and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi call upon House Speaker Paul Ryan to bring Congress back on track to push forward such measures.

Money dat come from many account, including $19 million dat shift from plan dat give subsidy for poor families lor heating oil, and $4 million dat shift from plan to tackle drug abuse (like heroin addiction).
Mrs Powell say, even with dat, dis extra fund can only last til next month, after which, if Parliament no take action, research institute fight Zika virus got to "seriously scale down many key work".
Centres for Disease Control and Prevention spend $60 million to help states protect pregnant women, $25 million to boost state Zika preparedness and response plans, and $16 million to help states set up data collection system so can quickly detect microcephaly and other Zika-related birth defects.

Experts say China's nuclear power is top-notch in terms of tech standards, safety features, operating experience, and all that, and also real cheap.
So, even though "nuclear power out to sea" will face some challenges in the short term, under the big win-win potential, the trend of mutual benefit cooperation will not change lah.
But UK's performance on the Hinkley Point nuclear project leh, no way can use dat phrase lah.
Project complete, meet 7% UK power demand; over 60 years, reduce 9 million tonnes CO2 emissions annually.
Analysts say, Britain's own economic risks, increasing domestic political divisions, complicated Brexit follow-up procedures, and growing uncertainties all combine to form obstacles for the nuclear project.
"Ahoy, current UK property prices drop, money leaking out, so must stabilise economy and market system lah, top priority for new UK government now. "
Same time, afta Brexit vote, UK also gotta face series of Brexit procedures, then sort out relations wit France and other EU countries.
Xu Mingqi say, "Although the new UK government wanna show a "different" attitude from the old one, but still no deny the positive effects of nuclear power.
But leh, UK's nuke power development stagnate lor, got 15 nuke plants already reach design lifespan most of them.

Low Xiaoming say dat dis project just need to get launched smoothly, so dat it can provide safe, reliable and sustainable energy to UK soon lah.
Industry folks say dat dis nuclear power plant project not only help Brits reduce electricity bills, but also boost local economy, create jobs lah.
So if Britain's new government ultimately make decision from maximise citizen welfare angle, then outlook for nuclear power project no so sad la.
"Ang Britain leh bantah energy demand gap, while China France duo leh sell own advantage technology product kat nuclear power sector, benefit more people leh."
"Although uncertainty increase for the Hinckley Point C project, but got confirmed dat China's nuclear tech is high level and experience is mature la."

Liu Xiaoming say China's nuclear power development for more than 30 years maintain good operating record and safety standards, and get international orgs' high praise for its achievements in nuclear power development and regulation.

After a brief substitution on the sidelines, Big Boss re-entered the game for a moment but troubles didn't really clear up, and he still had to be replaced by Song Boxuan at the 76th minute cos he couldn't hold on.
Wah, more horribah is, Big Brother cannot move, he was carried on stretcher, got treated on side la, near 10 minutes, then straight on ambulance lor.
Talkin' about "national player" la, if Big Brother get injured, it'll definitely affect our national team for the upcoming 12-strong tournament in half a month's time.
"Last week in the China away match against Shenhua, which ended 0-0 in the replay, Zheng Zhi already got injured lah, he fall down with Paulinho during a intense tackle, got injured in his neck."
Match leh Yu Hanshao suffer serious injury, which really touch heart, estimate need 4 months to recover, so Yu Hanshao miss at least half of 12 strong tournament games.
If Ah Boy's injury mah trouble, lineup for national football team upfront goin' suffer big impact lah.
Buta California University Berkeley lah engineers go further, develop tiny wireless sensor to monitor body health lah.
Researcher leh publish their invention on August 3rd in da journal Neuroscientist.
No lah, these sensors not only no need battery, can also use to stimulate nerves and muscles leh.
Disi nampaknya boleh provide one way treat disorder like epilepsy or activate body immune system.
Chio device leh put into mouse's muscle and nerve endings, use ultrasound lah as energy source and read data from it.
Sensor mini mini down to one cubic millimetre, call "nerve dust", got a piezoelectric crystal inside lah.
Dis paper's author say dis crystal convert da ultrasound vibrations emitted from da body outside into electricity to power a tiny transistor inside, which direct connect to a nerve or muscle fibre lah.
Pressure peak inside da fibre cause changes to da current loop and crystal vibration, which makes da ultrasound receiver (mainly still a source of ultrasound vibration now) detect da echoes.
Alrigh hor, since ultrasound technology very common in hospital, and ultrasound vibration can pass thru most of da body, it look like natural choice lah.
Michel Maharbiz sio assistant prof at UC Berkeley's Electrical Engineering and Computer Science lah.
"As co-corresponding author of the paper, he say in a statment, "I think the long-term prospects of neurodust is not just limited to the nervous system and brain lah, but is much more wide-reaching."
Maharbiz together wif colleagues and neuroscientist Jose Carmena from UC Berkeley lead dis research.
"He explain, "Using internal telemetry was previously impossible cos cannot put tiny thingy deep inside."
"But now, I can pick up tiny things, stick it beside the nerves or organs, intestine or muscle, and read the data lah."
Maharbiz and Caarmena test their device by send out six 540 nanosecond ultrasound pulses every 100 milliseconds to activate the sensor lah.
But research people got confidence lah, that dey also work in de brain and central nervous system.
"Project Neuro Dust aim la draw next gen brain-machine interaction, so that it become feasible clinical tech lah."
"If one lah handicapped patient wanna control a computer or robotic arm, you can implant this electrode into brain, it can work lor for lifetime."
Two cameras work together, differentiate foreground n' background well, create shallower depth of field.
Bukit Kintari earthquake not only damage Japan la, but also shock the whole digital camera core industry worldwide leh.
Since dat big earthquake in Kumamoto, Sony Japan factory got big losses, so worldwide digital camera supply got shortage, price also go up up.
Sony develop sensor la, use almost every camera, no sensor, camera no way produce lah.
Lah recent news show Sony collect near $3.6 billion in stock and bond form, tuh use lah money research and produce stack CMOS.
"Only Sony lah got da sensor supply, whether is digital camera or mobile smart device, imagine la if no Sony, tech industry become how, no know one."
"Actually, I still hope Sony can resume normal sensor supply lah, cos now camera prices very mahal already lah."
Meesi Departmental Store go close 100 shops.
Biggest departmental store chain Macy's say on Thursday dat dey plan to close 100 stores, big move dis to help company get rid of big problem - too many physical stores in US, where online shopping is all da rage.
M&S regularly review their store portfolio, closing down dozens of underperforming stores right after the annual peak holiday season.
"Actually, this big company announce in a summer statement that 15% of their 728 outlets will be closed down lah. This chainstore seem to be taking a more drastic step compared to many retail peers, reducing their shop size to cope with the fast-changing shopping environment nowa days."
Walkahs and shoppers goin' passa' in front of the Macy's store in New York.
Dat retail giant say plan to close 100 shops lah.
M&S got many reasons to make big changes leh, cos many of their shops are in small neighbourhood shopping malls which are badly hit by e-commerce lah.
Eh, since shoppers goin' more towards discount retailers (like T.J. Maxx) and fast fashion companies (like H&M) to buy clothes, the department store retail type be strugglein' big time lah.
These factors, plus some short-term issues (e.g. drop in international tourist spending, bad weather), make it a whole year of tough times for Marks & Spencer.
On Thursday, company say sales for recent quarter drop 2.6% compare to before, performance very weak but still better than 6.1% plunge in previous quarter.
Dat retail shop get sales of $5.87 billion (A$76.4 billion), down 3.9% from same period last year.
"Mahbok Messi say, shut down disa shop maa, annual sales loss got estimate around US$1 billion."
Before, such big scale shop closures can be seen as retailers' compromise leh, after fail to make a sale.
Buta stock jump 17% on Thursday show investors see dis as positive move indicating strong future performance for Massy Holdings.
From one angle, Messi Store close down shop not suppose be one surprise lah.
Mei Xi Baju CEO Terry Lundgren say, dis chain shop got too many outlets already.
Upper management been talkin' bout dis strategy lor, focusin' on top 150 performin' outlets, tryin' squeeze more sales from good doin' locations.
Jeff Ginnett, eksekutif utama Meyers Department Stores yang akan menggantikan Lennart Johansson pada tahun 2017, cakap dalam satu statement bahawa semua shop yang akan ditutup adalah shop yang sales dan profitnya down down.
Ginette say: "We confirm that these locations have insufficient returns on investment, and often fail to showcase the shopping experience we expect of our Massi brand customers."
Company say will give out list of shop dat go close soon.
M&S say still decide lah which shops to close, so no clear figure on how many jobs will be cutlah.
Dat retail shop no go full out from all the high-end malls where it still got outlets, but go look for close down shops which do not do well lah.
Dis ni boleh jadi bad news leh buat shoppiing centre operators, cos they rely on big tenants like Macy's to attract and keep small shops in shopping centre.
Water bottle you got got maybe got some dahsyat bacteria la.
According to new study, drink from refillable water bottle "may be worse in many cases than your household puppy's toys" in terms of number of bacteria you encounter.
Website name runceh run down lah, compeh EmLab P&K test 4 type water bottle (got cover type, slide type, squeeze type, and straw type) from 12 different bottle.
"Every bottle got used by one athlete per week, no wash lah."
Your house's refillable water bottle might be as dirty as a dog's toy.
Treadmill Reviews say, "Based on our tests of 12 refillable water bottles, we found that reusable drink containers can harbour staggering amounts of live bacteria cells: CFU numbers exceed 300,000 per square cm."
Experiment show dat water bottle with flip top got highest bacteria level, average got over 900,000 colony forming unit per square cm.
Bottle cap got hidden staphylococcus aureus bacteria, which can cause skin infection, pneumonia or blood poisoning.
Next la, squeeze bottle got 162000 bacteria per sq cm, while screw cap bottle got abt 160000 bacteria per sq cm.
"Site add: "Drinking from these bottles may be worse than feeding your pet from its bowl lah."
Results for the straw lid water bottle trial much better leh, got much less bacteria, only 25 CFU per square cm, less than other water bottles.
Maybe cos water get piped down to the straw bottom, no stay in bottle lah attract moisture bacteria.
Bacteria in bottle lids type water bottles described as "usually harmless" lah.
"Site say: "Based on test results, we recommend use of straw lid water bottle, cos it got lower bacterial prevalence and lesser harmful bacteria."
We also know lah, for the stainless steel water bottle and bacteria issue, it's better than plastic water bottle.
Also, bottle without holes and stains easy to clean got lower chance of become bacteria host lah.
Website advise readers to wash bottle after every use, best way is to use weak bleach solution.
Religion must modernise or else face extinction
America Democratic Party recently nominate Hillary Clinton as its President candidate.
If latest poll results still stay same la, first female President of US go take oath of office in January mah.
Last week on the other side of the Atlantic, British Prime Minister Theresa May was negotiating conditions with German Chancellor Angela Merkel for Britain's exit from EU.
Lah women growin' up in Western societies, they get influenced to believe they can achieve success in any career through education, ambition and hard work.
Nowah, young girls can look up to some real-life leaders who are already at the top.
Then mah long struggle to fight for women's equality rights finally over leh?
Hillary Clinton lafi try mah become US President, but still got controversy issue woh female leadership in religious area.
Okay, still got some more to go.
Lah, woman leadership still very debatable issue in religious sphere.
Last week, Pope Francis announce form new committee to discuss whether to appoint female deacons in Catholic Church.
"2015 Jan, Anglican Church in England appoint 1st female bishop, Libby Lane, after fail attempt in 2012 lah."
Actually, Jewish Reform movement start appointing female rabbis since early 70s, but since 80s, there's been conservative movement, still got big debate among Orthodox Jews on female rabbis.
November 2015, da US Orthodox Jewish Congress put out a stern statement sayin' female rabbis no good, dis be their third try to resist growin' support for Orthodox women bein' ordained as rabbis.
Irony leh, when Hillary Clinton get nominate as Democratic party's presidential candidate, some leading Orthodox rabbis in US start a series of "hearing" on this contentious issue, opposing women to be ordained as rabbis.
Between worldly life and religious life got big diff leh.
Mainstream Judaism also try to maintain stability by stickin' to traditional values lah.
Disi just reflect de pressure of adaptin to changin society.
Those opposing ones argue dat women bein' ordained go against "tradition".
But, got one price to pay lor, if wanna stick to traditional ways like dat.
Type of loyalty cost may make traditional community lose its lifeblood, resulting in unintended damage to tradition itself.
In da book "August Storm" dat write by Barbara Tuchman, she highlight da danger of puttin' tradition above all by callin' it "The Tragedy of the Red Pants".
Before World War One, coz of war goin from close combat to artillery shoot from far far away, gota keep soldiers hidin as long as possible, got da upper hand.
Britain and Germany army respond by change from bright uniform to dull grey and brown uniform.
Butaoh, French soldiers still wear same red hat and pants, so dey become very visible target on battlefield.
French Army Minister Adolf Méhely propose suggestion lor his army to follow same tactic, get larbeh laffs & opposition.
Red pants represent lah the honour and prestige of the army, and military traditionalists no plan to give it up lah.
Eugene Etienne datang share one speech at one Parliament hearing leh, talk bout France.
He holler, "Aiyoh, got to chuck the red pants lah?"
Lah!
Meimei later write " Blindly and stupidly clinging to the most eye-catching colours will bring about harsh consequences lah."
Religious leaders who resist women taking on religious leadership roles are actually falling into the same trap lah.
"Only worry about their traditional religious practices, without askin' themselves "What changes must we make to keep our religion relevant?" Risk is dat they lose out on 50% of the crowd lah.
Dey also block out de talent, skillz, passion of de women folks from contributing to da community lah.
From religious perspective, insistimah man wear same pants may stick to tradition, but like red shorts fail show, it not worth lah.
Dina Brawer laei start up British Orthodox Feminist Alliance, also studyin' to be an Orthodox rabbi at New York's "Yeshivat Maharat" Jewish seminary.
Charlton Athletic FC fans only get season tickets if dey sign a contract agreeing not to slag off de club on social media.
"Okay la, we respect everyone's right to their own opinion, but posting provocative stuff online no help lah."
Dat admin fan subsequently got told got to personally go to meet Cliff Eggleton, who just join club after 35 years of service, for tix.
“Oh ya, I need to remind you lah, the season tickets you get, it comes with some conditions, you know? You gotta sign a ‘behavioural contract’ thingy, where you promise to behave yourself, no posting any negative or inflammatory stuff about the club or its representatives on social media, and also no do anything that can be seen as antisocial behaviour.”
Dat fanboy describe in The Straits Times how he first pay money buy season ticket then call club, but two days later no ticket come but got letter sent instead.
"Yesterdey after the interview at da club, he say: "Dey tell me my tweets all extreme and influence others' tweets, I think it's ridiculous lah."
Cycling holiday along the Dalmatian Coast
Lah, actually I mean dat good deeds got good rewards, no need worry bout bad ones lah.
"Ah, my bum drop lah!" say Colleen, a former US Navy commander, after cycling 25km along a rugged Croatian coastline, sweatin' buckets and yellin' out naval-style curses at the tough mountain roads.
Some bicycle riders sing hymns or recite nursery rhymes to distract themselves while struggling uphill.
Colin's friend Pati recommend sing "The Wheels on the Bus".
Others either count their laps or quietly suffer, thinking how to enter into the meditative state that the seasoned riders call "zuo zong" (or more accurately in Singlish, "zone" lah).
Colin punceh Colleen with many kind of evil curse.
Riding ahead of her few feet lah like Hugh Grant chase in the opening scene of Four Weddings and a Funeral.
She and me task got to be doin' a week-long "luxury" cruise and cycling tour along the Dalmatian coast and islands up north in Croatia, organised by Freedom Treks lah.
Summer cycling lah in Croatia, where got so many steep hills, not really suitable for everybody's idea of luxury cycling, but supposedly, cycling in the north of Dalmatia easier than the south, we use comfort saddle, before those summer months when we all optimistic and confident fill up the booking form, there's this checkbox to check for e-bike assistance, but we no check.
Luxury part of dis deal is we get to stay in dat fancy "Melody" cruise ship for whole week, floatin' home.
End of cycling, we can just leave our bikes behind at the jetty, let Ivan and Ivana handle it. Then, we jump off from the back of the boat into the clear blue sea, can see all the urchins, sharp rocks and other people easily, this Croatian call it beach, got lotsa small flat stone like pebbles all around.
Sea temperature very ideal by end June, everybody agree, cool enough to wake up, but no feel cold.
If some one still feel got lotsa energy after dat tough cycling in da morning, then on the Symphony of the Seas, got mask, oxygen pipe, and few kayaks ready.
But most of us would rather go back to the aircon cabin lah, got Helena the massage lady on the ship (not joking), she already set up our bed, restock the fridge, and leave us a new box of chocolate on the table.
Ivan say, ride bike after dat must do some stretching lah, we do it in afternoon on our own bed or sofa on top deck, barman Tonyo ready serve us his special cocktail anytime.
Melody Cruise ain't no fancy super tanker lah, it's just a trendy little cruise ship, 42 metres long, with 15 cabins and a crew of half a dozen.
In the midst of all da fishing boats and holiday boats in dat small island's harbour, she really stood out lah, we on board feel real proud leh.
Colin and Patty from Washington D.C. USA, from a group organised through meetup.com, self-named "Exercise & Social Group for 45s plus".
Lah last year's Holland-organise barge n' bike holiday very success, so now they try somethin' more adventurous, so they come to Croatia lah.
"Chio one church in Provence, got small church competitor, so daily aft, got Facebook battle, try bring up da atmosphere lah!"
"Adventure stuffs in holidays maybe a bit over-exaggerate la, or else we no follow schedule leh."
"Ok lor, breakfast and dinner both at eight o'clock la, kaput already, welcome aboard, newbies!"
Ship's bell ring once mean self-service food start lah, ring again after eat finish mean everybody quiet down, listen to next briefing.
"Good moaning" leh, everybody already forget lah, one funny words only Brits maybe still remember.
Ai say lah, juz joke and play lah. Ivanah pull out dat day's hike map, we all pretend scary leh, but for cycling from coast to coast in Croatia, all other stuff go be surprise lah.
Ivan say: "Dis one leh, like heart-beat monitor."
Road no got no ups and downs also no goh recommend.
Ivan datok switch langat between English and German lah explain brief tui.
"Few weeks now, we got tourists from dozen countries la, but we are easy-going bunch (Swiss, German, American, British), so we sit down to eat, one table got English-speaking crowd, one table got German-speaking crowd, very convenient lor."
Everyone along the way become good frens.
"Friendship grow during cycling, only one competitor is the terrain lah, means self-competition lah."
This is my most chill, most relax group activity in my memory lah.
We switch lah radio to Ivan's frequency quick quick.
Tough uphill sections refer to, leh, the steep parts, no need to confuse with the winding ones which easier lah.
Hill roads refer to winding roads, while straight roads mean straight cycling: easy to understand but not always easy to ride.
Cycling command always same lah: "Single file, keep spacing, not race lah."
We collect at 9 o'clock at the jetty.
Okay lah, nine o’clock five, I forget you guys on holiday lah.
Must bring lotsa water.
"Weh start from Trgovište feri go two days ride north, pass through Konavle Island, where we ride long long time, wake up go walk in Trsteno Nature Park, see big big cliffs, got salt lake from underwater tunnel from sea water."
"Sayah, swimming in dis lake supposed to make you feel young again lah."
If go water la, foot become younger, stronger lor.
"Alah, we turn south again on this Morate island, jalan-jalan lepas at the mainland and nearby islands la."
Our cycling route mostly via rural quiet roads, with expansive sea views and fruit farms along the way - olive groves, vineyards and thorny bushes; got that Mediterranean feel lah, with butterflies flitting about everywhere.
Along the way got nice breeze lah, but places with shade super precious, so Ivan make car team stop and rest, and for early birds, cool little water pool like reward leh.
Dis movement with the social group got many group bike rides on weekends, they know the drill, keep reminding each other along the way, and also give way to cars so that drivers can overtake safely.
"U almost bonk into de front lah."
Lucky hor, they safe pass through.
Ivan divide us into three groups lah, when we cycle on main road sometimes, Ivanah bring up the rear, cheering us on, like Ivan say, "pulling us up" lah.
"Okay lah, when pass through main road, we all gather, alight walk, push bike across to safe side, follow instruction, no ownself think lah."
When we standing on roadside waiting for traffic light, Swiss cyclist ask, "You think Ivan realise he not bossing over kids leh?"
Our afternoons ain't always free lah.
Dalam da travel around da city of Zadar, we go visit Roman forum ruins and the Sea Organ, sound from Sea Organ like monster moanin' in cage, music come out from pipe face da sea, pipe set up in corridor made from stack of stone.
After dinner, when we enjoy our pudding lah, is also the best time to appreciate Zahdar's famous sunset view leh. After sunset, we head back to the beach organ, appreciate the light-up lights on the glass pavement powered by wave energy, like the ground is dancing mah.
"Ah, when da accordion's playin' loud one morning, sailin' to da lively resort town of Belgrade, da waves' melody sounds like whisper in ear la."
Fifth day la fully free ride lah.
